# Liquid Wormhole

Liquid Wormhole combines the ideas behind
[Ember Wormhole](https://github.com/yapplabs/ember-wormhole.git) with the power of
[Liquid Fire](http://ef4.github.io/liquid-fire/) to provide an accessible,
easy-to-use toolkit for both animating UI elements "above" your templates.

Interactive documentation can be found
[here](http://pzuraq.github.io/liquid-wormhole/).

## Ember Compatibility

Liquid Wormhole is tested on all versions of Ember >= 1.13. Long term support will
continue for 1.13 and up for as long Ember core support continues.

## Installation

```
ember install liquid-wormhole
```
