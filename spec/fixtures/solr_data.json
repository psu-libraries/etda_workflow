        "abstract_tesi":"Regression is the procedure that attempts to relate a\r\n$p$-dimensional vector of predictors $Xb$ with a response variable\r\n$Y$. Frequently, we deal with regression problems that have a large\r\namount of predictors.  In those cases, we try to reduce the\r\ndimension of our predictor vector.  The reason we are trying to\r\nreduce the dimension, is the necessity to find the predictors that\r\nwill affect our response the most. One of the most widely used\r\nmethods is the Principal Components Analysis. With this analysis, I\r\ntry to find the first few $d$ ($ll p$) principal components, that\r\nare generally believed to better describe the relationship between\r\npredictors $Xb$ and response $Y$.\r\n\r\nThis procedure however has not been appropriately justified. In\r\npractice, it often occurs that the first few principal components\r\nare more highly correlated with the response variable, and better\r\ndescribe the relationship between the predictors and the response\r\nvariable than the other principal components. However, there seems\r\nno logical reason for this tendency, and there are cases - albeit\r\nless often - where the first few principal components have weaker\r\ncorrelation with the response.  There is a long standing debate on\r\nthis issue among statisticians, and, todate, it has not been\r\nadequately resolved.\r\n\r\nIn this thesis I ask, and attempt to answer, the following\r\nquestions: Is there a tendency for the first few principal\r\ncomponents of the predictor to be more strongly related with the\r\nresponse?  If so, what is the reason behind this tendency? And how\r\nstrong is this tendency?\r\n\r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"Longitudinal research has demonstrated that symptoms of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) may continue to cause impairment into adulthood. Due to the nature of the diagnostic criteria for ADHD, clinicians must often rely on self-report data to make a diagnosis of the disorder in adults. However, self-report data is subject to intentional distortion, an issue which becomes a major concern when assessing for the disorder in the college population because students may perceive that there are benefits to having a documented diagnosis, such as helpful academic accommodations and prescriptions for medications. The purpose of the present study was to examine the ability of college students to fake a DSM-based diagnosis of ADHD on two different self-report measures, the ADHD Behavior Checklist (Murphy & Barkley, 1995) and the College ADHD Response Evaluation (CARE; Glutting, Sheslow, & Adams, 2002). Results indicated that college students without a history of ADHD diagnosis were significantly more likely than chance to be successful at faking the symptoms of ADHD on both rating scales. Approximately 93%, 69%, and 77% of participants met ADHD criteria based on the CARE factor-based items, the CARE DSM-IV symptom counts, and the ADHD Behavior Checklist items, respectively. Neither scale was more successful than the other at preventing false positives. Comparisons to other research and implications for practice are discussed.\r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"The study of the morphological and rheological behaviors of intramural vessels plays a critical role in various clinical applications such as surgical planning and radiotherapy. To better understand the rheological behavior of vascular structures in relation to the network morphology, we must obtain the concrete measurements of the morphometric parameters of the vascular networks under various conditions. Morphometric parameters of the networks include vessel diameter, branching points, branch end points, branch length, and branching angles. Because of the complexity of blood vessel morphology, however, it is difficult to obtain accurate measurements. In this thesis, we present a novel and efficient method for skeletonization of intramural vessel networks. The proposed method automatically skeletonizes the vascular network in a given image and constructs a graph structure that represents the branching structures of the network. Since the method processes a given image as a whole, the multiple vascular networks present in the image are automatically detected and skeletonized simultaneously. Moreover, since the skeletons are represented as graph structures, various morphometric parameters can be obtained automatically. We present the promising results of the proposed method applied to the complex structure of retinal vessel networks.",

        "abstract_tesi":"Using molecules designed to have only specific differences in their functionality, we have explored the influence of molecular conformation on the structural, electronic, and physical properties of self-assembled monolayers using both scanning probe and ensemble techniques. In the former case, we used two structurally similar molecules that differ in the degrees of freedom afforded to each. We found that this influenced the degree of order and conductance of self-assembled monolayers of each molecule, but had little influence of conductance switching of individual molecules inserted in alkanethiolate self-assembled monolayers.\r\nWe further demonstrated how molecular structure influences phase separation, displaceability,\r\nand molecular mobility of self-assembled monolayers by assembling 1-adamantanethiol on\r\nAu{111}. Molecular-resolution imaging of the self-assembled monolayers with the scanning tunneling\r\nmicroscopy confirmed a highly ordered hexagonally close-packed molecular lattice. We found\r\nthat the 1-adamantanethiolate self-assembled monolayers were susceptible to replacement by the\r\npresence of another thiolated species, both from solution and vapor phases. Additionally, we determined that the displacement process is a nucleation and growth mechanism and the structure of the resulting self-assembled monolayers is dependent on the strength of the intermolecular interactions of the displacing molecules\r\nIt was hypothesized that 1-adamantanethiolate displacement was driven by a combination\r\nof energies gained from the exchange of one self-assembled monolayer for a denser self-assembled\r\nmonolayer and from the increased stability due to intermolecular interaction forces.\r\nExploiting the susceptibility of the 1-adamantanethiolate self-assembled monolayers to displacement, we have designed a novel patterning strategy, termed ‘microdisplacement printing’, by\r\ncombining these sacrificial self-assembled monolayers with microcontact printing. During microdisplacement printing, a molecular ink is patterned by contact with a patterned stamp directly atop an existing adamantanethiolate self-assembled monolayer, displacing the self-assembled monolayer everywhere the self-assembled monolayer is contacted. In this way, artificial diffusion barriers are created that block lateral mobility of the stamped molecules during patterning, allowing the patterning of molecules that are otherwise not patternable by conventional techniques.\r\nWe also studied the influence of deposition time and the substrate species presence on\r\nmolecular transport during dip-pen nanolithography. The transport rate was dependent on the size of the patterned features, and slowed down as a function of total deposition time. Additionally, the transported molecules interacted with preexisiting substrate molecules, and the transport rate was influenced by the functionality of substrate species.\r\nThese studies demonstrate how complex assembles can be controlled by manipulating the properties of the individual components of the molecular device.",

Cluster analysis was performed using the Almost Perfect Scale-Revised (APS-R). The results of the cluster analysis yielded 3 clusters that represented adaptive perfectionists, maladaptive perfectionists, and non-perfectionists. These three groups were compared on their scores of the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSE), the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D), and the Cross Racial Identity Scale (CRIS).  \r\nThe findings showed that the APS-R is a valuable tool for investigating perfectionism among African American students at majority White universities. Adaptive perfectionists performed at a higher level than maladaptive perfectionists as evidenced by GPAs.  In addition, adaptive perfectionists had higher self-esteem scores than both the non-perfectionists and maladaptive perfectionists. Maladaptive perfectionists had higher levels of depression than adaptive perfectionists. Maladaptive perfectionists also were found to have higher scores in Pre-Encounter Self Hatred than adaptive perfectionists and lower scores in Internalization Multiculturalist Inclusive than adaptive perfectionists. \r\nThe study also focused on the current research findings for each scale, especially their validity and relevance to intercultural differences among groups. The limitations and strengths of this research are discussed and integrated. Finally, recommendations for further studies on these measures are suggested, particularly in relation to the utility of this research for African American college students. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Clostridium perfringens-mediated hemorrhagic enteritis and enterotoxemias in livestock, domestic animals, aquatic species and birds have imposed significant economic impact on animal husbandry. The anaerobic, nutrient-enriched environment of the mammalian gastrointestinal tract serves as an ideal habitat for the C. perfringens to proliferate and attain a disease inducing potential. The pathogenesis of the C. perfringens mediated enteric diseases can be attributed to the well characterized, lethal membrane active toxins such as alpha, beta, epsilon, iota, enterotoxin and perfringolysin O. \r\nIn recent years, a variant of the C. perfringens beta toxin known as beta2 has been widely reported as one of the causative agents in C. perfringens related enteric diseases. The clinical symptoms of beta2 toxin induced enterotoxemias are characterized by watery sporadic diarrhea, edema of affected tissues and loss of body weight. The role of beta2 toxin in the causation of enterotoxemias and or haemorrhagic/necrotic enteritis in humans, domestic animals, birds and aquatic species has generated considerable interest in the field of human and veterinary medicine. \r\nClostridium perfringens beta2 has been reported as an accessory toxin and may act in synergy with other major toxins of the C. perfringens in the production of necrotic and hemorrhagic enteritis. The beta2 toxin may play a role in hindering the process of nutrient absorption in the intestine and thereby debilitating affected animals. \r\nIt is strongly speculated that a sudden change in the gut Microbiolflora or the intestinal physiological equilibrium may lead to clostridial disease outbreak. Studies that report on C. perfringens beta2 producing isolates from healthy animals suggest that beta2 toxin as a potential health hazard. \r\n Very few studies have reported the biophysical and molecular biological properties of the beta2 toxin in detail. It has been hypothesized that the mechanism of the beta2 toxin induced enteritis could include direct effects on transport of ions in the intestinal epithelial cells through membrane binding or pore formation. It is felt that experiments that focus on studying the cytotoxicity of beta2 toxin could lead to better understanding of beta2 toxin in context of C. perfringens related enterotoxemias. Based on these reported findings, elucidation of the molecular and biological properties of beta2 toxin would be of significant value to researchers towards developing a targeted epitope vaccine. \r\nClostridium perfringens are toxinotyped into types A-E by conventional bacteriology and PCR based confirmation techniques. Owing to the widespread distribution of C. perfringens toxinotypes and its epidemiological significance a highly sensitive diagnostic tool that replaces the conventional PCR is required. In food animal practice, active immunoprophylaxis against C. perfringens is achieved by use of commercial toxoid vaccines against types B, C and D. There are no published reports on vaccines conferring immunity against beta2 toxin.\r\nThe primary objectives of this dissertation are (1) develop a molecular based toxin typing technique for C. perfringens which has practical application in a diagnostic laboratory and aid in conducting molecular epidemiological studies, (2) Elucidate the structure and function of beta2 toxin, 3) Evaluate in vitro the cytotoxic properties of beta2 toxin, and 4) Evaluate the role of beta2 synthetic lipopeptide vaccine in a challenge study in the mouse model.  \r\n\tThe results of our study revealed a high prevalence and distribution of C. perfringens beta2 toxin encoding strains in feces of lactating cattle. Among the five toxinotypes, toxinotype A was widely distributed among seven dairy herds screened by multiplex Real time PCR assay. We successfully used a GST fusion system for expression of recombinant beta2 toxin. The purified recombinant toxin was shown to be cytotoxic to CaCo2 cell line at concentration of more than 10 &#61549;g/ml. the toxin treated cells exhibited cytopathic effects such as cell rounding, membrane blebbing and leakage of cytoplasm. These results could suggest that the C. perfringens beta2 toxin could act as one of the pore forming toxins. A monoclonal antibody raised against beta2 toxin completely neutralized the cytopathic effects of the toxin on CaCo2 cells. \r\n\tTo study the physical structure of the beta2 toxin, recombinant beta2 toxin was crystallized in buffer comprising of 32-36% PEG in one week. Preliminary crystallographic analysis of the recombinant beta2 toxin suggested the crystals of the toxin belonged to space group R3. The triangular prism shaped crystals diffracted up to 2.9Å resolution and measured up to 200 Microbiolns in size. A novel approach of developing and evaluating a synthetic lipopeptide vaccine against C. perfringens beta2 toxin was demonstrated as part of this study. The lipopeptide conjugate chemically linked to Pam2Cys, successfully elicited a strong protective response in subcutaneously immunized mice. The immune response was characterized as mixed Th1 and Th2 response to the synthetic lipopeptide vaccine.\r\n\t It is anticipated that the results of our study will provide animal agriculture with an alternate approach to protect food producing animals against C. perfringens infections. The study will lead to the development and the standardization of a real-time PCR based technique to identify and quantify the various toxigenic strains of C. perfringens directly from clinical samples. The structure and function studies demonstrated in our study will provide a better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of beta2 toxin and the development of a safe and effective vaccine against beta2 toxin. \r\n\r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"\r\nPurpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate race/ethnic and age group disparities in the rates of admission for ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSC) among children living in Pennsylvania. Ambulatory care-sensitive conditions (ACSC) are illnesses such as asthma, dehydration, and bacterial pneumonia for which appropriate preventative and primary ambulatory care can greatly reduce the need for hospitalization. Rates of admission for these conditions are often viewed as indicators of the quality of primary care. Race/ethnic and age group differentials in the rates of admission for ACSC among children living in Pennsylvania during 2001 and 2005 are compared.\r\n \r\nStudy Design: Rates of admission for the 10 most common ACS conditions are examined for African American, Hispanic, and white children aged 0-4, 5-9, 10-14, and 15-19 years, using 2001 and 2005 data from the Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Council’s (PHC4) hospital discharge database and population information from the US Census Bureau. Logistic regression models are estimated to determine statistically significant differences in ACSC admission rates by race/ethnicity and age, and significant changes in these rate differences over time. \r\n\r\nPopulation Studied: African-American, Hispanic and white children aged 0 to 19 years living in Pennsylvania during 2001 and 2005.\r\n\r\nPrincipal Findings: African American children had higher rates of admission for most ACSC compared to Hispanics and whites in both 2001 and 2005. Hispanic children also had higher rates of admission for most ACSC compared to whites in both years, but the Hispanic-white disparities were not as pronounced as the African American-white disparities. Further, children who were younger tend to have higher rates of admission compared to older children.    Comparisons of trends from 2001 to 2005 in ACSC hospitalization rate disparities are mixed, with disparities for some ACSC conditions increasing and some decreasing in each childhood age group.  Many disparities in 2005, however, were not significantly changed from those observed in 2001. \r\n\r\nConclusions: There are race/ethnic disparities in the rates of admission for ACSC among children living in Pennsylvania, and these disparities are most pronounced between African Americans and whites. Age group disparities also exist, with younger children being more likely to be admitted for ACSC compared to older children. Overall, the race/ethnic disparities have not changed significantly in 2005 compared to 2001.\r\n\r\nPolicy Implications: Mechanisms underlying disparities in the rates of admission for ACSC among Pennsylvania children need to be investigated. Also, the fact that the disparities observed in 2001 were largely unchanged in 2005 implies that little progress was made between those years. Policy interventions that promote equitable, timely, and affordable access to quality care for all Pennsylvania children are needed.\r\n\r\n",

These ozonesonde profiles can be clustered using self-organizing maps.  Self-organizing maps use a learning algorithm to reveal the most prominent data features of a data set.  These clusters can then be compared to different meteorological phenomena to determine the effects the meteorology has on different ozonesonde profile types.  Analysis of ozonesondes from Ascension Island, located at 7.98S and 14.42W, and Natal, located at 5.42S and 35.38W, using self-organizing maps reveals different ozonesonde profile types that deviate from the average ozone.  A 2x2 self-organizing map, which creates 4 clusters, reveals that deviations from the average ozone are both increased ozone resulting from seasonal biomass burning in Africa and convection vertically mixing ozone.  Expanding to a 4x4 self-organizing map shows how biomass burning influences the yearly cycle of tropospheric ozone at Ascension Island and displays the seasonality of ozone at both Ascension Island and Natal.  Finally, comparing Ascension Island and Natal using a 4x4 self-organizing map of both locations reveals similarities in mid-tropospheric ozone, but shows differences in lower tropospheric ozone due to Ascension Island being closer to biomoass burning from Africa and due to differences in the underlying meteorology.

The history of Alaskan Christian missions is unique: Alaska developed as an arbitrary cultural/geographical construct and also one of the few regions where representatives of all three main historical branches of Christianity – Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant – proselytized simultaneously.  Alaska is viewed as a special landscape where dynamic cross-cultural interactions and multi-denominational –in the case of Protestant – missionary ventures took place.  Fierce competition characterized the regional cultural exchange at some times, reciprocity and friendly contacts at others.  Those involved were the priests of the Russian Orthodox Church, Jesuit missionaries, Presbyterian, Episcopalian and Moravian preachers – men and women – as well as representatives of the Russian American Company, the Hudson’s Bay Company’s entrepreneurs and American fur traders.\r\nIn this geographically remote and environmentally severe region, the Native populations – the Aleuts and Athapaskans, Tlingits and Haidas, Tsimsheans and Inuits –played an independent and crucial role in cross-cultural conversation.  They were active participants in a complex process in which different sides had to alter their cultural attitudes, religious traditions, and ideological values in continuous interaction with each other.  Thus, eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Alaska was a place where the existing religious and cultural identities of Natives and colonists dynamically interacted in a process of mutual transformation.\r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"PRAS40 and DEPTOR are mTOR binding proteins that affect cell metabolism.  Under catabolic conditions such as sepsis and glucocorticoid excess, there is an increase in total DEPTOR protein and a reduction in phosphorylation of PRAS40, suggesting that these proteins may modulate the mTOR-mediated protein synthetic response under normal and diseased conditions.  The hypothesis of the present study was that knock down (KD) of PRAS40 or DEPTOR in C2C12 myocytes will increase protein synthesis via stimulating mTOR-S6K1 signaling.  PRAS40 and DEPTOR KD was achieved using lentiviral particles containing shRNA to target the mouse PRAS40 and DEPTOR mRNA sequence, whereas control cells were transfected with a scrambled control shRNA.  KD reduced PRAS40 and DEPTOR mRNA and protein content by 90%.  PRAS40 KD did not result in increased phosphorylation of mTOR substrates or increased protein synthesis, whereas, DEPTOR KD increased both phosphorylation of mTOR kinase substrates, 4E-BP1 and S6K1, and protein synthesis.  The responsiveness of PRAS40 and DEPTOR KD myocytes to anabolic (IGF-I) and catabolic (AICAR) stimuli was unaltered.  Both PRAS40 and DEPTOR KD myoblasts were larger in diameter and exhibited an increased mean cell volume compared to scramble control.  PRAS40 KD cells had decreased phosphorylation (S807/S811) of pRb protein.  In contrast, DEPTOR KD cells had an increased phosphorylation (S807/S811) of pRb protein which is critical for the G1-S phase transition, coincident with an increased percentage of cells in the S phase.  Neither PRAS40 nor DEPTOR KD altered myoblast apoptosis as evidenced by the lack of change for cleaved caspase-3.  Although DEPTOR KD myoblasts did not alter autophagy as determined by a lack of change in the ratio of LC3BII/LC3BI, PRAS40 KD myoblasts had a reduced ratio of LC3BII/LC3BI.  While PRAS40 KD delayed myotube formation concurrent with delayed proliferation, DEPTOR KD had the opposite effect on myogenesis and proliferation.  Finally, while in vivo DEPTOR KD (~50% reduction) by electroporation into the muscle of C57/BL6 mice did not alter weight or protein synthesis in the control muscle, it prevented atrophy produced by 3 days of hindlimb immobilization, at least in part by increasing protein synthesis.  Thus, our data support the hypothesis that PRAS40 and DEPTOR are important regulators of protein metabolism in myocytes and demonstrate that, while PRAS40 is required for normal myoblast growth and function, decreasing DEPTOR expression is sufficient to ameliorate the atrophic response produced by immobilization.\r\n",

Since the decision concerning whether or not to participate in risky sexual behaviors can be difficult to make in isolation, college-aged individuals may turn to their friends for assistance. Previous research validates the potential influence of friends on one’s sexual behavior. Because friends are valued candidates for consultation when making difficult decisions, it is critical to understand how the role of friendship communication may influence sexual behavior. \r\n\r\nThis dissertation had three goals all focused on analyzing the ways in which sexually transmitted infections and unintended pregnancies can be prevented among college-aged individuals. The first was to apply the regret regulation theory to interpersonal college-aged friendships. The regret regulation theory proposes that individuals will evaluate the possibility of experiencing regret, often with significant others, when decisions are important. The second goal was to test the parts of the theory relating to the anticipation of regret. The theory suggests that individuals will regulate regret according to levels of anticipated regret. Finally, the third goal was to acquire information concerning social support among friends during conversations involving sexual decision-making.  \r\n\r\nTwo foundational studies and one main study contributed to the pursuit of these goals. Study 1 was an investigation of the sexual decision-making conversation of college-aged individuals with their friends as well as the types of social support provided during these conversations. The data were used to generate twenty-four scenarios based on the contextual details provided by the participants in conjunction with varying levels of anticipated regret and social support. Study 2 was a survey involving six scenarios in which a sample of participants rated events for typicality and relational importance to their friendships. Study 3 entailed use of a 2 (anticipated regret: low and high) x 2 (social support: positive and negative) design with participants completing measures of friendship quality, as well as sexual disclosures and behavior. In addition, the participants reviewed, rated, and responded to the hypothetical scenario identified as the most typical - one depicting a conversation among friends about whether or not to engage in a hook-up. The participants’ intentions to engage in the hook-up and to seek friend’s input in the future were also matters of interest.\r\n\r\nThe results of the studies indicated that college-aged individuals make sexual decisions both with and without the assistance of their same-sex friends. Participants rated the hypothetical scenarios detailing sexual decision conversations as typical, although not highly important to their friendships. The initial test of regret regulation theory revealed that anticipated regret was a strong predictor of intentions to engage in sexual behavior. The interaction effects were not significant; however, which indicated issues with its utility for the sexual decision-making process as related to emerging adulthood friendship consultation and support. The analyses showed positive social support to be a strong predictor for participants who reported strong intentions to seek a friend’s advice in the future. Open-ended data reinforced this finding with esteem (ego) support reported being communicated most frequently during sexual decision conversations. Sex differences indicated that male college-aged individuals had greater expressed inclinations to engage in the behavior; females had greater intentions to seek the friend’s advice in the future and also reported higher levels of anticipated regret than males.\r\n\r\nThe findings of each study are discussed with a particular focus on how the studies contribute to the existing research in the sexuality and communication fields. Theoretical, methodological, and practical contributions of this dissertation are outlined while also noting the importance of studying the role of friendship especially during a time period critical to the development of one’s sexual identity and skills necessary for later romantic relationships. Finally, the limitations of this dissertation are acknowledged, and future directions for research involving sexual decision-making are proposed. \r\n\r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"This study investigated the effects of a widely advocated organizational reform for secondary schools, the small school model, on the collective efficacy beliefs of teachers.  Using social cognitive theory, a theoretical model was developed linking the communal structure of the small schools model to the collective efficacy beliefs of teachers. The case study was conducted at a suburban high school in the northeastern United States which operated under a grade-level house system.  Research was gathered through administration of a 21-item survey and extensive personal interviews.  Initial survey data indicated a strong sense of collective efficacy beliefs which was confirmed through the interview process.  Themes that emerged as contributing factors to the collective efficacy beliefs included: house design, professional learning communities (pods), leadership/planning, faculty disposition, advisory structure, physical plant/facility, community, and student body.  Results indicated the small schools model is linked to high collective efficacy beliefs.  The house system provided the initial structural framework for downsizing; however, it was the summative efforts of several factors that produced the collaborative culture and positive climate embodying the highly efficacious organization.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"In Escherichia coli K12, the TonB system serves to couple the electrochemical gradient of the cytoplasmic membrane, protonmotive force (pmf), to high affinity TonB-gated outer membrane transporters, promoting active transport of iron-siderophore complexes and vitamin B12 across the outer membrane.  Iron is essential for E. coli but bioavailable iron is scarce in the environment, making this a critical process in the competition for survival of these cells.  In other Gram negative bacterial species, TonB energizes transport of heme, maltodextrin, sucrose, and nickel.  The precise mechanism of TonB-dependent energy coupling is unknown and studies aim to elucidate the details involved in this process.  In the cytoplasmic membrane, TonB is thought to form a hetero-oligomeric complex with two other integral membrane proteins, ExbB and ExbD.  ExbB and ExbD appear to harness the pmf to energize TonB.  TonB spans the periplasm, retaining cytoplasmic membrane association, directly contacts OM transporters, and transmits energy for release of ligands into the periplasm.  ExbD and TonB each have a single transmembrane domain (TMD), with the majority of each protein occupying the periplasm, while ExbB has three transmembrane domains with the majority of soluble domains in the cytoplasm.  TonB is a conformationally dynamic protein, and ExbD is proposed to direct the conformational changes of TonB.  \r\nThis study addressed the role of ExbD in TonB-dependent energy transduction and provides evidence to support the proposed function of ExbD in modulating TonB conformation.  Formaldehyde crosslinking was used to identify ExbD-specific interactions in vivo.  ExbD crosslinked into a homodimer and ExbB-ExbD or TonB-ExbD heterodimers.  The TonB-ExbD heterodimer was dependent on the presence of ExbB, supporting the predicted formation of a multimeric energy transduction complex.  The first mechanistic role for pmf was identified, where pmf is required for specific periplasmic domain interaction that allows crosslinking of ExbD to TonB.  The importance of wild-type TMDs of ExbD and TonB for this interaction suggests a role for signaling from the TMD to the periplasmic domain.  Pmf-dependent conformational changes in the TonB system were further examined with limited proteolysis studies.    ExbD conformation was demonstrated to be responsive to changes in pmf.  Pmf appears to be a toggle switch for TonB and ExbD conformational changes.  ExbD was also shown to determine the ability of TonB to change conformation in response to pmf, with distinct roles of the ExbD TMD and periplasmic domain.  A model is proposed for three stages leading to energization of TonB, emphasizing the importance of the ExbD periplasmic domain for TonB to progress to subsequent stages.  The importance of the ExbD periplasmic domain was also apparent in further studies addressing specific regions of ExbD important in its function, using a 10-residue deletion scanning analysis.  Functional division of the ExbD periplasmic domain is proposed, with residues 42-61 important in response to pmf and residues 62-141 important for interaction with TonB.  The conformation of the region between residues 92-121 was especially important in supporting multiple ExbD protein-protein interactions.  Subsequent studies focused on this region with cysteine scanning and disulfide crosslinking.  Multiple sites of homodimeric interaction in vivo were identified.  Specific interaction with TonB was observed through many of the same sites.  Studies of TonB-ExbD interaction were extended to 45 individual cysteine substitutions in the TonB carboxy terminus.  Three of six ExbD cys substitutions examined in combination with these TonB substitutions formed multiple disulfide-linked heterodimeric interactions.  A wild-type ExbD TMD and ExbB were important for disulfide-linked heterodimer but not homodimer formation.  A model is presented where the default configuration of the ExbD periplasmic domain is dimeric with transition from localized homodimeric interactions to heterodimeric interactions with TonB, mediated by the ExbD TMD.  Specific interaction sites on TonB further suggested interaction with ExbD may resolve TonB homodimeric interfaces and configure the TonB periplasmic domain for productive interaction with OM transporters.  This work has provided significant insight into the functional role of ExbD in TonB energization and expanded knowledge of both the mechanisms and sequence of events involved in the cycle of TonB-dependent energy transduction.",

Beta-lactams were used for clinical mastitis, dry cow therapy, metritis, and pneumonia; while tetracycline was primarily used in medicated milk replacers. Extralabel use of antibiotics was practiced on many farms. Extralabel use of a third generation cephalosporin, Ceftiofur was reported by 18% of the dairy herds surveyed.  Recommended prudent practices of antibiotic usage (record keeping, written treatment plans, following labeled instructions, and veterinarian's advice on antibiotic usage) were not widely practiced. It is felt that current practices related to the antimicrobial usage on farms could contribute to the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria. \r\n      Lactating dairy cattle (n=313) on 33 dairy herds were examined for antibiotic resistant gram-negative enteric bacteria. Gram-negative enteric bacteria resistant to ampicillin, oxytetracycline, florfenicol, spectinomycin, and neomycin were isolated from feces of 31, 31, 7, 5, and 1% of lactating cows, respectively. Gram-negative enteric bacteria resistant to ampicillin, florfenicol, neomycin, tetracycline, and spectinomycin accounted for 9, 5, 1, 14, and 10% of the total Gram-negative enteric bacteria. Gram-negative enteric bacteria belonging to 12 species were isolated from dairy cattle, of which Escherichia coli (87%) was the most predominant species. Monte Carlo analysis revealed that E. coli would require 126 days to undergo a 3 log reduction when held in sterile water at 7oC. It was observed that dairy producers that fed medicated milk replacers to calves were 3.4 fold more likely to have lactating cattle shed tetracycline-resistant Gram-negative enteric bacteria. However a similar relationship was not observed with calves. Ampicillin- and tetracycline-resistant E. coli were the predominant isolates among the gram-negative species isolated and these isolates were genetically diverse. The findings of the study suggest that resistant Gram-negative enteric microflora was widely prevalent on farms. \r\n      Tetracycline determinants tet(B) and tet(A) were detected in 93 and 7% of the isolates, respectively. These tet determinants were located on the chromosome, and sequence analysis revealed association of tetR and tetA with transposon Tn10. This is the first report of a chromosomally located tet efflux pump associated with Tn10 in enteric E. coli isolated from lactating cattle. The results of this study show that one of the pathways through which tetracycline resistance can be mediated is through transposable element Tn10 that harbor a tet(B) determinant. \r\n      Ampicillin resistant enteric E. coli (n=94 isolates) from lactating cattle were examined for susceptibility to other antibiotics and genetic determinants that encode for beta-lactam resistance. The majority of the E. coli isolates were resistant to tetracycline (88%) followed by chloramphenicol (30%), spectinomycin (35%), ticarcillin (33%), ticarcillin/ clavulanic acid (23%) and ceftiofur (27%). Multidrug resistance (>3 to 8 antimicrobial agents) was observed in 44 of 94 (47%) isolates, interestingly on most occasions multidrug resistant ceftiofur isolates were also resistant to chloramphenicol. All E. coli isolates were susceptible to the 4th generation cephalosporin cefepime. The extended-spectrum beta-lactamase enzymes were not detected in ceftiofur resistant isolates. Ampicillin-resistant isolates contained blaTEM, while ceftiofur-resistant isolates contained cephamycinase (blaCMY). Class I integrons of >1 kb were observed in 10 of 75 E. coli isolates. Sequence analysis revealed that the integrons encoded for streptomycin and spectinomycin (aadA), and/or trimethoprim (dfr) resistance. \r\nThese findings suggest commensal enteric E. coli and other Gram-negative enteric bacteria from lactating cattle can be a significant reservoir of antibiotic-resistant determinants. Widespread prevalence of antibiotic-resistant E. coli could also pose a risk to public health as these organisms have the ability to survive for long periods in the environment and could gain access to the food chain. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Disparities due to race exist in the Latino populations, some of which are consistent with racial disparities in the non-Latino population. Research on racial disparities and gender disparities in state Vocational rehabilitation (VR) has shown differences in the access to services and the outcomes of those services. Gender research has shown that women with disabilities tend to be accepted for services more frequently if their disabilities are less than severe. Research also shows that although women are accepted more frequently than men with disabilities, their cases are closed more as homemakers and less consistently with their goals than are men’s cases and more often in a non-goal-related status of homemaker (Danek & Lawrence, 1985). Findings suggested that while no main effect for gender or race existed in VR acceptance rates of Latino/as with disabilities in the 2007 fiscal year, the likelihoods of interaction effects (on VR acceptance rates) between gender and race, gender and severity of disability, race and severity of disability, and race and primary source of support were highly significant.",

        "abstract_tesi":"Having evolved from of a profession that has undergone profound transformations since the beginning of the century, renewed municipal political and administrative structures, and Parisians’ own expressed wishes for more and improved green space, the large urban parks created by the City of Paris from 1977 to 1995, including the Parc André-Citroën, Parc de Bercy, and Promenade plantée, dramatically altered perceptions of urban landscape design potential. Aesthetically complex, theoretically sophisticated, and mindful of their social role within the city, these parks were developed by architects and landscape architects selected through high-profile design competitions and were grafted into sectors of the city undergoing renovation and renewal. As such, they provided a true alternative to the uniformity, functionalism, and traditional style that had been the trademark of the city parks service, laboring under the weight of Second Empire’s style municipal and the reductive spatial grammar of Modernism. Rather, these parks offered fresh approaches to the garden tradition and reoriented the symbolic geography of the city. \r\nThis dissertation proposes a cultural analysis of Parisian public parks during the period 1977-1995 with the aims of analyzing these parks from an aesthetic and cultural point of view, and exploring their impact on broader questions of cultural memory, image construction, and contemporary urban design, using this phenomenon as a prism through which to better understand contemporary France. \r\nMy formal and contextual analysis of these parks is situated at the intersection of two fields: French studies and landscape and garden studies. The former, which draws methods and perspectives from the cultural history of the present as applied to the everyday urban environment, provides an understanding of the socio-cultural context and political stakes of urban park creation. The latter offers concepts and theories addressing society’s culturally-mediated relationship to nature, drawing on related disciplines whose shared purview is the articulation and qualitative perception of space, such as the visual arts, architecture, and cultural geography. Both fields practice poststructuralist readings of visual culture. This study is ultimately conceived as a contribution, through the object park, to French cultural studies, for which the city, public space, the environment, and ecology are subjects of increasing scholarly interest. \r\nThe study shows how each of the three parks, by using traditional stylistic elements devalued or abandoned in Modernist green space design, and by engaging with history and memory as well as with current contexts, become heterotopic sites (to borrow Michel Foucault’s terminology). Rather than owing this otherness to their soothing vegetal elements in contrast to the roil of the surrounding city, the symbolic and poetic nature of these parks predominates over nature and its representation, so that they stimulate an allusive, metaphorical, or allegorical experience. This quest for an aesthetically and symbolically engaging experience in the urban context resonates with Bernard Huet’s vision of l’art urbain, meaning urban design grounded in principles of interdisciplinarity, a heightened appreciation for the city as the site of everyday life, and sensitivity to perception and representation within the urban landscape. The choice to project complex aesthetic and ecological sensitivity into the public sphere while taking up historical themes and styles in a critical manner suggests a possible definition of a French postmodern garden. This turn to the qualitative as part of an effort to reconcile a storied past with not just the concrete demands of the present but also the contemporary imagination is central to urban design and architecture in Paris as in urban centers around the globe.",

        "abstract_tesi":"High oil prices and environmental concerns serve to drive up the efficiencies of land based, power generation gas turbines. Increasing efficiencies requires raising the temperature of the air entering the turbine section of the engine.  Turbine components must be protected from the increased air temperatures by advanced cooling designs that provide coolant to the hot flow surfaces. Secondary flows reduce the effectiveness of coolant injected along the vane endwalls as well as increase endwall heat transfer. Endwall contouring and strategic coolant injection can alter secondary flows to allow for improved endwall cooling, ultimately allowing for higher engine efficiencies. \r\nThis research initially focused on understanding the flow physics and subsequent cooling characteristics of an axisymmetric contoured vane passage. Results indicated that coolant injected from discrete holes provided lower effectiveness values on the contoured endwall in comparison to the flat endwalls of the planar and contoured passages. Coolant coverage from the upstream interface slot, however, was spread over a larger area of the contoured endwall in comparison to the flat endwalls as the interface slot was oriented closer to the plane of the contoured endwall. Seeking a fundamental understanding of interface slot coolant injection, further investigation into the effects of orientation and position of slot injection on secondary flows and the net heat flux experienced by a vane endwall was conducted. Results indicated that cooling effectiveness levels can be improved and the horseshoe vortex reduced in size by moving the interface slot closer to the passage inlet.  At large injection rates, reducing the slot orientation resulted in the removal of the horseshoe vortex and a subsequent reduction in passage secondary flows leading to a reduction in the average heat load experienced by the endwall.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"This dissertation examines the ways that five contemporary artists—Mark Dion (b. 1961), Fred Tomaselli (b. 1956), Walton Ford (b. 1960), Roxy Paine (b. 1966) and Cy Twombly (b. 1928)—have adopted the visual traditions and theoretical formulations of historical natural history to explore longstanding relationships between “nature” and “culture” and begin new dialogues about emerging paradigms, wherein plants, animals and fungi engage in ecologically-conscious dialogues. Using motifs such as curiosity cabinets and systems of taxonomy, these artists demonstrate a growing interest in the paradigms of natural history. For these practitioners natural history operates within the realm of history, memory and mythology, inspiring them to make works that examine a scientific paradigm long thought to be obsolete. \r\n\r\nThis study, which itself takes on the form of a curiosity cabinet, identifies three points of consonance among these artists. First, these artists are concerned with acknowledging, adhering to, or subverting the borders of naturalist taxonomy. They have appropriated this scientific system of classification, that applies names to organisms—“species”—to question and undermine the very nature of culturally-constructed categories. Ultimately, their critiques are concerned with the very categorization of knowledge itself. Second, these artists demonstrate a sustained engagement with organismal bodies, attending to plants, non-human animals and fungi and how they have been applied to our wider culture. Delving into ontology, they provide a space where viewers may come to terms with, and simultaneously envision, what it is to be a human being, in a body, in the late twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Third, in an attempt to resolve a historical past in the present, Dion, Tomaselli, Paine, Ford and Twombly use natural history to explore and negotiate memory and mythology in the process of their retreat into eighteenth- and nineteenth-century natural history, its golden age. \r\n\r\nI take Aby Warburg’s (1866-1929) Mnemosyne, or Atlas Project (1927-29), as a model for understanding historical natural history as a field of observation and recollection, which attended to memory, or according to Warburg, the past conceptualized in the present. Guided by an associative model, Warburg’s project continues to challenge traditional patterns of conceptualizing objects and images and their relationship to one another, leaving us to contemplate our own evolutionary pasts and place within the order of things. The artists here rely on a similar associative model to reckon with history, memories and presentness in the process of constructing new ways of seeing. They have discovered in natural history, as Warburg himself attempted to do with his “serpent” and “nymph,” a kind of resolution of memory and “trauma.” For these artists, trauma is complex and subtle, scattered across a field of colonialism, ecological destruction, and reductive nature-culture bifurcations. It exists in, among other things, the consolidation of living beings into the homogenous category of “life” and the relegation of the field of nature to the laboratory of science, exterior to our own processes of becoming. These artists beckon us with a Visionary Natural History: Through the space of their own serpents and nymphs—historical natural history—they demonstrate an awareness that acknowledges a past both violent and full of promise, rich with possibilties for constructing new ways of seeing and being.\r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"The shortage of special education teachers is a critical issue facing rural school districts. Administrators face moderate to extreme difficulties recruiting special educators and some are unable to fill positions at all. The retention of teachers to special education postions in rural schools is part of any comprehensive plan to deal with teacher shortages. Research in the broader field of special education has demonstrated that work-related support, defined as the ability to ask questions and problem-solve student related issues, increases teachers’ levels of satisfaction and commitment to their position. However, retention research conducted in rural areas is often limited by a focus on one state or region, and/or a small sample size. This study investigated, through survey research, several aspects of teacher support and their relationship to teacher commitment and satisfaction with a randomly selected, national sample (n = 203) of rural special education teachers. The results reveal a significant relationship between the extent and helpfulness of teachers’ support networks and levels of teacher satisfaction, perceived efficacy, and willingness to choose the profession again. Furthermore, individual sources of support, particularly support from building and special education administrators and general education teachers, significantly contributed to the outcomes related to teacher commitment.\r\n\r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"Although the plantation is most often associated with the antebellum U.S. south, the modern plantation complex was first introduced as a system of economic and cultural domination in sixteenth-century Ireland. This model of settler colonialism was soon exported to the New World and spawned a range of social institutions and cultural artifacts, including a genre of literature. While plantation fiction seemed to reach the height of its popularity in the United States after emancipation, the genre was revived in the twentieth century by Irish, Caribbean, and American writers. Indeed, the genre was revised with surprising frequency by modernists from a wide variety of national and cultural backgrounds, including Elizabeth Bowen, Liam O’Flaherty, Jean Rhys, Claude McKay, Eric Walrond, Arna Bontemps, and of course, William Faulkner. Serving as an important device of cultural linkage, plantation fiction offers a way of understanding the reverberations of empire in transatlantic modernity.\r\n\r\nWhile writers of nineteenth-century plantation romance sought its origins in feudalism, the plantation in fact emerged out of the capitalist-imperial ventures of the maritime bourgeoisie of early modern Europe. Plantation ideology derived not from steadfast traditions, but rather from the demands of the market and the defense of property, often human. My project concentrates on Anglophone plantation culture from roughly 1890 through 1950. I track the vast changes in the plantation complex that took place during the modern period, including the transformations that occurred after emancipation, the shift from traditional colonial-settler (family owned) plantations to corporate ventures and state owned plantations, and the simultaneous rise of British decolonization and American imperial expansion. The modernist era marks a shift in global production patterns, as the plantation complex adumbrates transnational agribusiness, and the literature of this period attempts to grapple with the clash between these residual and emergent capitalist agricultural forms.  \r\n\r\nAlthough the plantation complex is an institution of empire, it would be wrong to expect that all plantation fiction simply serves the ideological imperatives of empire (as it might when the archive is limited to nineteenth-century American writers). Broadening the definition of “plantation fiction” beyond the narrow confines of plantation romance reveals more ideologically diverse and critical representations of the plantation’s role in producing and sustaining empire. Modernist plantation fiction underscores the plantation’s global socio-economic reach by tracing the flow of capital and people to the metropole from plantation cultures. I argue that plantation modernism uses modernist techniques to focus narrative through perspectives from postlapsarian plantation cultures: octoroon mistresses, exploited field hands, disaffected and dishonored planters’ daughters, and other characters burdened by the legacies of the plantation past.  Works like Elizabeth Bowen’s The Last September, Jean Rhys’s Voyage in the Dark, Claude McKay’s Banana Bottom, and William Faulkner’s Absalom, Absalom! experiment with the generic conventions established by plantation romance in order to reveal the local manifestations of global capitalism and mediate between imperial centers and peripheralized regions. Plantation modernism’s cosmopolitan style embraces epistemological and political uncertainty, and foregrounds the forms of cosmopolitanism that emerge among  plantation modernity’s voluntary and involuntary diasporas. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"In recent years the process of visually interacting with data has become increasingly important as a method for understanding the rich amounts of data collected.  The geography of health and disease is a domain that has great potential to benefit from such interactive visualization.  Geographical information systems (GIS) have already become a substantial visual tool to assist medical geographers, public health planners, epidemiologists, and others working with spatial distribution of health related data. Geovisualization builds on the utility of traditional GIS through a design meant to elicit data exploration from the user.  Users can observe relationships not only across space but also examine relationships between multiple variables and over time.  Geovisualization has proven to be useful for exploratory data analysis in epidemiology and public health, but it has yet to be adopted by epidemiologists and public health practitioners as a widely accepted method to explore or analyze epidemiological data.  Facilitating adoption requires fitting the tool to the user and their tasks.  This research is part of that larger goal to fit geovisualization tools to the needs of epidemiological analysts.  Through in-depth case studies with epidemiological data researchers using a geovisualization application for data exploration and analysis, I address 1) what tasks these experts engage in while working in a geovisualization tool, 2) how they approach accomplishing their tasks, and 3) what tools, features or statistics are necessary to support their data exploration.  Using task models (Knapp 1995), I organize and present the tasks of these epidemiological analysts, as well as the physical actions they took toward achieving the tasks, mental actions during the process of doing the tasks, and the visual operators utilized to achieve understanding to complete the task.  Analyzing these task models for contiguity between their components, characteristics among the models and between the two participants, and what types of issues prevented the participants from moving forward in their tasks, led to the identification of five broad classes of functions necessary within a geovisualization application in order to enable completion of user tasks:  1) filters and selections, 2) making comparisons, 3) seeking statistical feedback, 4) analyzing more than two variables at a time and 5) exporting information (visually or as a table).  I also established that there are several factors that influence how a user approaches accomplishing a task.  Those factors include 1) the users’ visualization goals and the flexibility they have to address their goals via access to data and changing data, 2) what part of the research process they are in with the data they are exploring, 3) their experience and training with GIS and spatial methods, and 4) their usual methods of inquiry outside ESTAT.  The in-depth case studies presented in this thesis provide examples of the utility of geovisualization for health-related research, and contribute evidence toward ways geovisualization can improve to meet epidemiological users’ needs.    \r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"Igor Stravinsky’s opera The Nightingale (1908-1914), based on a fairy tale by the Danish author Hans Christian Andersen (1805-1875), provides a unique example of the composer’s evolving compositional process. Stravinsky finished the opera’s first act in 1908, but the commission of The Firebird (1910) delayed The Nightingale’s completion. Not until 1914, after the premiere of The Rite of Spring (1913), did Stravinsky complete his opera. The Nightingale is significant because in the opera Stravinsky attempted to find his own voice while striving to abandon the influences of Romanticism. With the exception of Richard Taruskin’s analysis of selected musical sketches, the work has received limited in-depth scholarly attention. This may be due to the juxtaposition of Romantic and Modernist styles within the opera, resulting from the period of time separating the completion of the last two acts (1913-1914) from the first (1908). However, that abeyance in Stravinsky’s compositional process provides an opportunity to observe, in a single work, Stravinsky’s transition from Romanticism to Modernism.\r\n\r\n    This thesis provides an analysis of The Nightingale that examines passages that illustrate the duality between Stravinsky’s compositional styles, such as the contrast between the Real and Mechanical Nightingales. Set theory and Pieter van den Toorn’s observations about Stravinsky’s use of octatonicism and bitonality provide the framework for some of my analysis. Musical sketches for Stravinsky’s opera, housed in the Stravinsky Archive of Paul Sacher Stiftung will also be used to investigate the duality between the compositional processes Stravinsky used to compose the first act (completed in 1908) in and the subsequent two acts (completed in 1914).",

Yet our understanding of how teachers develop an understanding of classroom management is limited. Furthermore, our understanding of what, if any, role their teacher education courses played in the development and mastery of that understanding is extremely limited. The author observed eleven world language education (WLED) students in their first field experience and analyzed the reflective writing of two of the participants to seek insight into the development of their ideas about and implementation of classroom management. A grounded theory emerged in alignment with Levin & Nolanes (2010) notions about classroom management beliefs and practices of education students. Participants emerged from the experience with their initial ideas about classroom management further entrenched in their beliefs and practices, despite receiving detailed written supervisor comments which occasionally conflicted with some of those beliefs. Classroom management skills. acquired were largely empirical in nature and lacked the kind of generalizability to new situations required to lower the cognitive and affective load of the education students in novel situations. According to sociocultural theory, this indicates a need for a different kind of mediation of students, or at the very least, a more conceptual, scientific presentation of classroom management theory to the WLED students. This raises the question of what kind(s) of instructional interventions could mediate the WLED students to develop more abstract and generalizable notions of classroom management so as to substantially increase the feelings of success of WLED students in their role as teacher and provide more effective instruction, resulting in more effective development of L2 skills on the part of their students.\r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"Bernard Herrmann’s score to Psycho, Alfred Hitchcock’s definitive slasher film from 1960, enhances the emotional and mental aspects of the characters through musical techniques designed to complement the image track.  This thesis explores the connections between the plot design and character development of Marion and Norman in a musical context, focusing on their juxtaposition through the first half of the film.  While superficially different, both lead characters fall to temptation and commit crimes.  Marion’s larceny eventually leads her to Norman, while his homicide catalyzes the second half of the plot.  The character shift from Marion to Norman is prepared by the shift in musical language from tertian to atonal in the Madhouse cue.  The culmination of the thesis examines this cue’s status as a musical hinge in the film’s two-part structure.\r\nThrough his use of form, pitch material, rhythm, and motives, Herrmann gives voice to the wordless subconsciouses of Marion and Norman.  This thesis demonstrates the compositional design through a variety of film and musical analytical techniques, revealing a soundtrack sensitively composed to function within the diegesis without being present in the world of the story.  It centers on the analysis of cues selected for the significance of their scenes and the development of the characters.  The problematic nature of diegetic and nondiegetic definitions and the examination of the more traditionally humanistic versus nonhumanistic aspects of the cues underlie the connection of the music to the minds of the characters with which they are associated.  The music is analyzed according to form, pitch material, and rhythm, enhanced by their context in the story.  Due to the wide-ranging structure of the cues from traditional, tertian schemes to nontertian, atonal material, the techniques vary from harmonic, set class, interval class, and contour analyses.\r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"In order to increase the fidelity and perceived realism of synthesized sonic booms, a model was created which superimposes specular reflections, arising from simple terrain and buildings, on the sonic boom signature that would be recorded in the free field. A finite impulse response (FIR) filter characterizing the listening environment and source/receiver orientation is generated using the Image Source Method (ISM). The generation of an FIR filter predicting specular reflections was automated for a receiver in any planar geometry:\r\nreflections from more complicated terrain and structures could be approximated by thoughtfully created planar geometries. The ray based Image Source Method (ISM), common to architectural acoustics, was adapted for outdoor applications and sonic boom excitations. Each reflection originating from a finite surface (i.e. not the ground) was high pass filtered with a roll-off determined by the dimensions of the reflecting surface.\r\n\r\nAccurately accounting for reflections from the ground and a single structure was shown to dramatically alter subjective loudness metrics.\r\nSimulations over a variety of listener positions and incident angles demonstrated that constructive and destructive interference due to inclusion of specular reflections varies the PLdB by &#8722;11 to +3 dB. a\r\n\r\nPost boom noise (PBN), the 1.5 seconds of rumble following the tail shock of a sonic boom, is necessary for synthesized and recorded sonic booms to be perceived as realistic in listening tests. In flat landscapes with a single structure, it was found that simplifying the scattering problem and calculating specular reflections from rigid sources is an insufficient approach to modeling PBN. However, using a data-set known as HouseVIBES 2007, in which sonic boom records were acquired by a 10 meter, 10 element vertical array, ground reflections and potential sources of post boom noise were explored.\r\n\r\nAnalysis of the data set indicated that scaling ground reflected sonic booms with a plane wave reflection coefficient would underestimate the reflected pressure at low frequencies. By contrasting the PBN at the ground with that above the turbulent boundary layer, it was shown that engine and jet noise were not dominant sources of PBN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"This dissertation concerns the relationship between education and health.  While this is not a new topic, the focus of this research is to explicitly model the education and health decision process and estimate such a model. Compared to current literature which focuses on statistical modeling as opposed to economic modeling of the decision, this project allows for deeper intuitive and policy analysis.\r\n\r\nChapter one reviews the Economics literature on the relationship between health and education.  It then discusses the current issues in the literature and proposes a solution to some of those problems.  This chapter also provides a simple economic model of health and education choice from which a more complicated dynamic model is derived in chapter two.\r\n\r\nChapter two proposes a dynamic model of health and education choice allowing for unobserved heterogeneity. This model is then estimated using data from the Health and Retirement Study.  Results from the estimation suggest that an exogenous increase in education only increases expectation of life by approximately one third of the amount typically reported in the current literature.\r\n\r\nChapter three performs various robustness checks on the structural estimation described in chapter one.  One test is to simulate data from the estimated model and perform statistical analysis analogous to what the current literature would perform on real data.  This analysis shows that while the model predicts a far less mortality decline from a year of school, simulated data still generates the same results as real data when put to the standard analysis.  The other major test performed in this chapter is to vary the amount of unobserved heterogeneity allowed in the model to see how sensitive it is to this number.\r\n\r\nChapter four performs various policy experiments using the model estimated in chapter one.  It examines the cost and benefits of compulsory education policy, college cost policy, and smoking policies.  While all of these policies have various effects, this chapter only looks at the health benefits of these levers and compares the various cost benefit ratios.  Ultimately the conclusion is that even with the reduced benefit of education compared to the current literature, education investment as a health policy is most likely effective.  However, policies that target health decisions, especially smoking are superior in terms of cost benefit ratios.",

        "abstract_tesi":"Recent research in language contact has investigated bilingual deviations from monolingual norms where syntax interfaces with the lexical and discourse components of the grammar (e.g. Iverson & Rothman 2008; Lozano 2006; Montrul 2004, 2005; Sorace & Filiaci 2006; Tsimpli et al. 2004). Such studies generally show that the ‘external’ syntax-discourse interface displays more optionality in language contact and is more vulnerable to attrition than the ‘internal’ syntax-lexicon interface, and this is termed the ‘Interface Vulnerability Hypothesis’ (see Dominguez, 2009; Montrul, 2011). This dissertation further investigates the syntax-lexicon and syntax-discourse interfaces through a study of word order with unaccusative and unergative predicates in different focus contexts for native speakers of Bajío Mexican Spanish.\r\n\r\nThe factors that constrain subject-verb or verb-subject word order in Spanish have been the subject of previous studies (e.g. Bolinger, 1991; Delbecque, 1988; Silva-Corvalán, 1982), and the word order of intransitive verbs has recently received attention in studies using variationist approaches (e.g. Rivas, 2008; Mayoral Hernández, 2006; Ocampo, 2005) and structuralist approaches (e.g. Hertel, 2000; Hertel & Pérez-Leroux, 1998; Lozano, 2003, 2006a; Montrul, 2005a, 2005b, 2006). A number of lexical and discourse-related factors have been reported to constrain the variable use of preverbal or postverbal subjects with intransitive verbs, but they are often overlooked in studies of word order, and other relevant factors, such as the ‘Auxiliary Selection Hierarchy’ (Sorace, 2000, 2004), a continuum of lexico-semantic notions underlying unaccusativity, have not been thoroughly investigated. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this dissertation is to investigate language-internal and language-external factors that may constrain word order variation at the syntax-lexicon and syntax-discourse interfaces in Bajío Mexican Spanish. For this study, an oral production task and an acceptability judgment task were administered to native speakers of Bajío Mexican Spanish residing near Irapuato, Mexico, and the results for 29 participants were included in the analyses. The results of these tasks reveal instability at both the syntax-discourse and syntax-lexicon interfaces and show that focus type,definiteness, subject NP weight, the position of adverbial phrases, and the verb categories of the ‘Auxiliary Selection Hierarchy’ significantly favor particular word orders. Previously unnoticed verbal constructions that relate to word order are identified, and it is also suggested that cyclical migrants may influence the word order of Bajío Mexican Spanish.\r\n\r\nThis dissertation is an important addition to current research because it identifies, tests, and ranks several language-internal and language-external variables for their effects on word order at the syntax-lexicon and syntax-discourse interfaces. In addition, the Interface Vulnerability Hypothesis is shown to be relevant for native speakers of Spanish living in Mexico because more word order variation is found to occur for these speakers at the syntax-discourse interface than at the syntax-lexicon interface in the production task. The results of this study do lend support for the Interface Vulnerability Hypothesis, but also show times in which ‘external’ interfaces may show less word order variation than ‘internal’ interfaces. \r\n\r\nThis research makes a significant contribution to studies of unaccusativity in Spanish by comparing and reanalyzing the results of previous studies of unaccusativity in Spanish and by noticing parallels with historical changes and contact Spanish. This study also demonstrates that the ‘Auxiliary Selection Hierarchy’ can help to explain word order in Spanish and should be termed the ‘Split Intransitivity Hierarchy’ because of its cross-linguistic application. A ‘cutoff point’ or transition zone between unergativity and unaccusativity is found for Spanish that situates Spanish crosslinguistically as being similar to Italian, but not yet like Dutch or French. A list of twenty proposed tests for unaccusativity in Spanish is also compiled for future research.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"Changes in measured electrical conductivity are related to measured changes in aqueous concentrations of ions.  In previous work anomalous increases in electrical conductivity measured in and around contaminated aquifers have been associated with biogeochemical activity.  The respiration and growth of micro-organisms has been suggested as a possible cause of these conductivity signals.  However, a quantitative link between the activity of micro-organisms and electrical conductivity has not been established. \r\nIn this dissertation changes in the fluid electrical conductivity (&#963;f) and &#963;b are related to changes in chemical concentrations at multiple scales.  Changes in &#963;f can be interpreted as reaction rates if the stoichiometry of the reaction is understood.  Results from batch experiments demonstrate that measured changes in &#963;f over time document rates of abiotic and biotic reduction of goethite. \r\nIn two column reactors packed with sediments from Oyster Virginia and fed with an input containing dissolved acetate, measured changes in &#963;b initially document biogeochemical reaction rates of iron reduction or nitrate reduction.  Eventually, &#963;b becomes decoupled from changes in chemical concentrations and increases significantly.  Fe(II) adsorption does not cause &#963;b to become decoupled from aqueous chemistry.  Instead, this decoupling is attributed to the growth and presence of an electrically conductive biofilm.  Reactive transport modeling is used to constrain the amount of biomass produced in each reactor.  A value for electrical conductivity is estimated that depends on the calculated growth in biomass and the assumed density of that biomass.  For iron-reducing conditions biofilms, the model is consistent with values of biofilm conductivity > 2.2 S/m, and for nitrate reducing conditions, with conductivity > 300 S/m.  These values are the first estimates for biofilm electrical conductivity based on column reactor experiments.  \r\nThe results of a field-scale tracer test involving nitrate reduction are also presented.  The results suggest that electrical conductivity may be able to track biogeochemical activity if the tracers are large enough and conductive enough to be detectable.  Finally, results of preliminary electrochemical experiments designed to directly measure the conductivity of biofilms are presented.  Methods for improving the accuracy of these experiments are proposed.\r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"CD4+ T cell activation is a prerequisite for productive HIV-1 infection and replication.  Therefore, the virus has evolved mechanisms to exploit host cellular factors to promote its own propagation.  Relatively little is known regarding the interplay between proteins involved in T cell activation and HIV-1.  The purpose of this work was to investigate the relationship between signals in the TcR/CD3/CD28 pathway and HIV-1 replication.  \r\nT cell stimulation through TcR/CD3 induces low level HIV-1 transcription.  However, maximal HIV-1 expression requires the simultaneous ligation of a costimulatory receptor, such as CD28.  Although the significance of transcription factors NF-ƒÛB, NF-AT, Sp1, and AP-1 in T cell activation-induced HIV-1 gene expression is well established, little is known regarding the specific cis-acting elements and the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) region mediating the CD28 related enhancement of HIV-1 transcription.  Using deletional analysis of the HIV-LTR in conjunction with electromobility shift assay (EMSA), we determined that the enhanced HIV-1 transcription in response to CD28 ligation was mediated through the binding of a specific protein to a potential CD28 response element (HIV-28RE) in the region spanning-182 to -205 of the HIV-LTR.  This finding illustrates the positive regulation of HIV-1 expression by molecules in the T cell signaling pathway.\r\nThe tight link between HIV-1 transcription and T cell activation and its dependence on host transcription factors suggests that provirus activity would be silenced as an infected cell transitioned from an activated to a resting state, such as during the process of anergy or memory induction.  This is thought to be the underlying mechanism of HIV-1 postintegration latency.  The population of resting memory CD4+ T cells harboring latent virus represents the primary barrier against eradication of the virus in HAART patients.  The cellular mediators of the establishment of this reservoir are largely unknown due to the difficulty in the isolation of latent cells in vivo and the lack of available representative in vitro models.  We have developed a novel in vitro system to identify the molecular events involved in silencing the HIV-1 provirus.  This model utilizes a virus engineered to express placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) on its surface upon virus transcription in conjunction with the removal of this marker by Phospholipase C treatment.  Measurement of PLAP re-expression is used as an indicator of the HIV-1 transcriptional response to various signal manipulations.  Using this experimental approach, we demonstrated that suboptimal T cell signaling that activates the calcium pathway induces a reversible, long-term suppression of HIV-1 transcription that may represent a latent state.  These findings indicate that signals in the TcR/CD28 pathway can negatively regulate HIV-1 gene expression. \r\nThe role of Lck, an early and integral member of the T cell activation pathway, was assessed via the infection of Lck deficient T cell lines.  HIV-1 replication was consistently attenuated in the absence of Lck, suggesting that Lck was positively regulating HIV-1 expression.  However, a series of experiments determined that Lck was not influencing HIV-1 transcription or the early stages of the virus life-cycle, but instead was mediating the later stages of the virus life cycle, namely HIV-1 assembly.  HIV-1 particles accumulated in the intracellular compartments of cells lacking Lck, suggesting that Lck was facilitating the progression of HIV-1 from the microvesicles to the plasma membrane for efficient virus release.  This novel function of Lck did not involve its kinase activity but was mediated through a physical interaction between Lck and Gag.   \r\nThese findings indicate that T cell signaling proteins can both positively and negatively regulate HIV-1 transcription, and can play important unforeseen roles in other stages of the virus life cycle, such as HIV-1 assembly.  Insight regarding the interplay between T cell signals and HIV-1 will lead to a better understanding of how the virus exploits host proteins to promote its replication and will ultimately provide targets for future therapeutic intervention.\r\n",

Bandwidth has become the limiting factor for many communication systems. One popular solution for efficient bandwidth utilization is Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) which is used as the physical layer modulation underneath Code Division Multiple Accesses (CDMA).\r\n\r\n\tIn Direct Sequence – Code Division Multiple Access (DS-CDMA), every user acts as an interferer to every other user. This fundamental issue limits the number of users that can be placed on a single frequency band. The implementation of Power Control, causing the power of every user at the receiver to be nearly the same, increased the capacity of the channel. One newer technique being analyzed to improve DS-CDMA channel capacity is Multi-user Detection (MUD) or multi-user interference mitigation. One type of interference mitigation is Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC). Currently, SIC is not feasible to be implemented in mobile devices due to of the computation time and power consumption needed.  \r\n\r\nScale-Time Offset Robust Modulation (STORM) is being presented in this paper as an alternative physical layer to help with synchronization for SIC on a DS-CDMA channel. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), a highly reactive gas, is the major component of photochemical smog and causes a reproducible heterogeneous pattern of lung injury.  We hypothesize that this spatial distribution of lung injury mirrors an analogous distribution of O<sub>3</sub> dose delivered to different tissue sites in the respiratory tract. The purposes of this study were: 1) to predict the local uptake of O<sub>3</sub> using three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD); and 2) to investigate the effects of flow rate, airway structure and chemical reaction in the respiratory tract lining fluid (RTLF) on O<sub>3</sub> uptake.  These objectives were achieved by using the commercial CFD package FLUENT (ANSYS Inc., Lebanon, NH) to numerically solve the three-dimensional continuity, Navier-Stokes, and convection-diffusion equations in single idealized airway bifurcations as well as an anatomically accurate airway geometry. \r\n<p>To investigate the effect of flow rate on O<sub>3</sub> uptake, steady inspiratory and expiratory flow simulations in an idealized symmetric bifurcation with a branching angle of 90° were performed at Reynolds numbers based on the parent branch radius (Re) ranging from 100 to 500.  The reaction of O<sub>3</sub> in the RTLF was assumed to be so rapid that O<sub>3</sub> concentration was negligible along the entire surface of the bifurcation wall.  The total rate of O<sub>3</sub> uptake was found to increase with increasing flow rate during both inspiration and expiration.  Hot spots of O<sub>3</sub> flux appeared at the carina of the bifurcation for virtually all inspiratory and expiratory Re considered in the simulations.  At the lowest expiratory Re, however, the location of the maximum flux was shifted to the outer wall of the daughter branch.  For expiratory flow, additional hot spots of flux were found on the parent branch wall just downstream of the branching region. \r\n<p>To investigate the effects of airway structure, steady inspiratory and expiratory flow simulations were conducted in single idealized airway bifurcations at Re = 300, also assuming an infinitely fast reaction in the RTLF.    The effect of branching angle was studied in three idealized symmetric single airway bifurcations with branching angles of 45°, 90°, and 135°.  The average dimensionless flux < N > (dimensionless uptake rate normalized by dimensionless surface area) increased with increasing branching angle during both inspiratory and expiratory flows.  The effect of the mode of branching was studied by comparing simulations in an idealized symmetric 90° bifurcation to those conducted in an idealized monopodial 90° bifurcation.  The overall < N > in the symmetric 90° bifurcation was higher than in the monopodial bifurcation during inspiratory and expiratory flow.    During inspiratory flow, the minor daughter branch of the monopodial bifurcation had the highest < N >  of all the regions in both geometries.\r\n<p>Before incorporating a finite RTLF reaction into the CFD model, two RTLF reaction models were compared, both modeling the interaction between O<sub>3</sub> and endogenous substrates in the RTLF as quasi-steady lateral diffusion with homogeneous chemical reaction.  The first reaction model assumed a reaction rate that was pseudo-first order with respect to of O<sub>3</sub> concentration, while the second assumed a reaction rate that was first order with respect to both the O<sub>3</sub> 3 and substrate concentrations and second order overall.  The of O<sub>3</sub> concentration profiles within the RTLF as well as the flux of of O<sub>3</sub> into the RTLF and tissue were virtually identical in the two models.  Because of its greater simplicity, the pseudo-first order reaction model was selected for incorporation into the CFD simulations investigating the effects of RTLF reaction-diffusion parameters on O<sub>3</sub>  uptake distribution.\r\n<p>To study the effect of RTLF thickness on O<sub>3</sub> uptake into the RTLF and underlying tissue, the pseudo-first order reaction rate constant was characterized by defining a dimensionless Damkohler number, based on the parent  branch radius (Da<sub>R</sub>).  Steady inspiratory flow simulations at Re=300 were carried out at Da<sub>R</sub> = 1.7x10<sup>7</sup>  and Da<sub>R</sub> = 1.7x10<sup>10</sup>  on idealized symmetric 90° bifurcations with RTLF thicknesses ranging from 0.014% to 0.282% of the parent branch radius.  The rate of uptake in the RTLF was generally insensitive to the thickness of the RTLF layer, except at the lower Da<sub>R</sub>  at which the RTLF uptake rate increased markedly as the ELF thickness was reduced below about 0.07% of the airway radius.  At the lower Da<sub>R</sub>, the tissue uptake rates were more sensitive to RTLF thickness than were the RTLF uptake rates, but at the higher Da<sub>R</sub>, no O<sub>3</sub> reached the tissue, regardless of RTLF thickness.\r\nThe effect of the reaction rate constant, characterized by the Damkohler number based on the RTLF thickness (Da), was investigated by simulating flow and O<sub>3</sub> uptake in the idealized 90° symmetric and 90° monopodial bifurcations at Re of 10, 100, and also at Re = 1000 in the symmetric bifurcation, for Da  ranging from 1 to 10<sub>6</sub>.  An increase in   led to an increased rate of O<sub>3</sub> uptake into the RTLF but a reduced uptake rate in the underlying tissue. The sensitivity of both uptake rates to flow rate became more pronounced as the reaction rate constant was increased.\r\n<p>In the final study, two steady inspiratory flow simulations at Re = 152  in an anatomically accurate geometry representative of the first three generations of the airways of a rhesus monkey beginning at the trachea was constructed.  Steady inspiratory flow simulations were conducted, one assuming an instantaneous reaction at the bifurcation walls and the other assuming a pseudo first order RTLF reaction at an intermediate Da of 1000.  In both simulations, hot spots of flux were located at all three carinas of the geometry, similar to what was found in the idealized single airway bifurcations.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"The degree to which insect herbivores and plant pathogens elicit accumulation of phenolic defenses in plants is variable in nature.  Because light and leaf development, factors which can alter resource levels in chloroplasts, influence enemy responses to plants, I was interested in the degree to which chloroplast carbon resources constrain phenolic induction responses.  To address the central role of the chloroplast in supplying carbon resources for induced phenolic accumulation, I devised the Chloroplast Control Hypothesis: constraints on phenolic induction occur when stromal substrates are limited.  Levels of carbon resources were manipulated by shading plants and monitoring phenolic accumulation responses to Jasmonic acid (JA), a wound signal that elicits phenolic metabolism in plant leaves much as does wounding or herbivory.  Phenolic accumulation was prevented in darkened tobacco plants, and low light constrained phenolic accumulation, but photosynthetic carbon assimilation was a poor predictor of resource investment in phenolic defenses.  While young leaves which are carbon resource sinks were more responsive to JA, metabolite import was not enhanced in these leaves.  In fact, activity of the chloroplast phosphoenolpyruvate/ phosphate transporter was not required for Arabidopsis plants to mount strong shikimate-based defense responses that deterred an insect herbivore.  These results suggest that chloroplasts must possess alternate means of acquiring substrates for induced phenolic synthesis, possibly via starch breakdown.  I was unable to disprove the chloroplast control hypothesis, as mechanisms of resource allocation to induced phenolics are much more complex than I originally envisioned.  Chloroplasts may possess at least three avenues to acquire carbon resources for the shikimate pathway, allowing plants to compensate for deficiencies in one route when others are limiting.  Such redundancy in resource supply may not be surprising since products of this pathway play central roles in plant physiology.  ",

        "abstract_tesi":"Rafael Leonidas Trujillo’s dictatorship over the Dominican Republic had a profound effect on the country’s literary tradition. Between the years of 1930 and 1961, Trujillo carefully positioned himself at the center of all things Dominican—including the island’s cultural and intellectual discourse. From the beginning of Trujillo’s political career, the dictator’s team of spin-doctors, carefully selected from among the Dominican intelligentsia systematically, exploited the media, poetry, prose narrative, and even popular music to construct a public persona that would eventually grow to mythological proportions.  \r\nGiven the trujillato’s notorious use of literature in mythologizing Trujillo, it is hardly surprising that, in the years immediately following his death, Dominican writers would also employ narrative in their efforts to de/re-mythologize him. The present study examines how four prominent novelists—Marcio Veloz Maggiolo, Andrés L. Mateo, Viriato Sención, and Mario Vargas Llosa—use literature to reexamine and rewrite Trujillo’s 30-year rule over the Dominican Republic. These writers also typify the evolution of the Dominican novel over the last 40 years. Like other Latin American “dictator novels,” the texts studied here—which include De abril en adelante (1975), La balada de Alfonsina Bairán (1985), Los que falsificaron la firma de Dios (1992) and La fiesta del chivo—call attention to both the hegemonic processes that empower and the rhetorical structures that help to shore up authoritarian rule. Building upon the ideas of Ross Chambers, René Girard, Roberto González Echevarría and others, this thesis examines how these writers’ works attempt to create “room for maneuver” between the discourse of dictatorship and the dictatorship of narrative convention. My primary assertion is that the rhetorical “free space” created by oppositional texts, when inserted into the dictator’s system of signification, creates the potential for readers’ desires to be shifted away from the dictator and toward a dissenting (frequently the narrative) voice. While large-scale social change brought about via readers reading novels such as those studied here is unlikely, these works chip away at the dictator’s power structure by targeting and changing his constituency one reader at a time.

        "abstract_tesi":"Conventional methods of quantifying segmental and peristaltic motion in animal models are highly invasive; involving, for example, the external isolation of segments of the gastrointestinal(GI) tract either from dead or anesthetized animals. The present study was undertaken to determine the utility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to quantitatively analyze these motions in the jejunum region of anesthetized rats (N = 6) non-invasively. Dynamic images of the GI tract after oral gavage with a gadolinium (Gd) contrast agent were acquired at a rate of six frames per second, followed by image segmentation based\r\non a combination of three-dimensional live wire (3D LW) and directional dynamic gradient vector &#64258;ow snakes (DDGVFS). Quantitative analysis of the variation in diameter at a &#64257;xed constricting location showed clear indications of both segmental and peristaltic motions. Quantitative analysis of the frequency response gave results in good agreement with those acquired in previous studies using invasive measurement techniques. The results of integrated and Fourier analysis of peristaltic and segmental motility suggest that the neurophysiology underlying the control of motility can be considered much simpler. For example the results of integrated analysis suggest segmental vs. peristaltic wave patterns must be represented primarily by the phase relationships among the principal components. Alternatively the results of Fourier analysis suggest peristalsis is represented by a single wave propagating in the aboral direction and a simple segmental pattern is a resultant of two\r\nwaves propagating in opposite directions. A complex segmental motility requires a third high frequency segmental mode to complete the complex patterning. MRI results also show that inactin anesthesia does not have the same inhibitory e&#64256;ects on the gut motility as iso&#64258;urane, con&#64257;rming indirect data in the literature acquired using invasive techniques, but also adding detailed knowledge of the changes in gastrointestinal motions produced by these\r\nanesthetics.\r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"Association control algorithms play a significant factor in the performance of mobile clients traversing a dense wireless mesh network. In this paper, we introduce TAR, a novel association control algorithm which uses trip prediction alongside previous knowledge of the wireless network topology in order to select the APs which the client will associate with. We note that different applications have different wireless requirements. Interactive applications will demand a minimum amount of bandwidth and the least number of handoffs which introduce unwanted hiccups in live service (e.g. VoIP or live video). Non-interactive applications have no time demands but desire the maximum throughput possible. With cross-layer communication, the application can notify TAR about its bandwidth requirements and whether it wishes to perform handoff reduction or maximum throughput. Furthermore, we propose a distributed fairness mechanism around a weighted max-min scheme to allow interactive users to gain priority during the association cycle, perform a sort of load balancing, and act as a quality-of-service admission control. This can either be done with assistance from the AP or through peer-to-peer coordination with a mobile peer-to-peer database of client-AP associations. We then show that these algorithms perform better than some commonly known and deployed association control algorithms, which tradeoff simplicity for poor performance in mobile scenarios.\r\n",

There are many theoretical models proposing defect-based mechanisms for the non-classical rotational inertia (NCRI) that is observed in torsional oscillator measurements. It is clear that further experimental work is necessary to determine if any of the present models are applicable to solid 4He.\r\nThese issues have been addressed in two parts. First, the behavior of solid hydrogen under rotation was investigated in order to determine if the possible supersolid phase is unique to 4He. Although there are clear indications of quantum mechanical motion of residual ortho-hydrogen impurities within the solid, NCRI is not observed in any solid H2 samples.\r\nSecond, modifications to the traditional experimental apparatus were employed in order to make it possible to grow solid 4He at a fixed point on the solid-liquid coexistence curve within a torsional oscillator for the first time. A vast improvement in the overall reproducibility of the data is consistent with the formation of single crystals within the sample cell. The onset of NCRI is consistently found to be 79mK in helium crystals containing only ~1ppb of isotopic impurities. These results demonstrate that the supersolid-like behavior of solid 4He is not associated with superfluid liquid flowing along grain boundaries.\r\nFurther results suggest that vortices exist in the solid, and that the onset of NCRI corresponds to the temperature at which their motion is suppressed. Below ~35mK the vortices are strongly pinned.\r\n",

The probe is cylindrical and sized using orbital-motion-limited theory.  The on-board electronics include two electrometers, two calibration boards, a control and processing board, and a power regulation board.  Raw data is sent to the on-board spacecraft computer, where the computer can process the data or send raw data down to the data downlink ground station.

The objective was to better understand how docents conceive of their role and what shapes the interpretation they give on tours to the public. \r\n     The conceptual frameworks that informed the study were hermeneutics and symbolic interactionism. Hermeneutical principles lend themselves well to understanding how docents act as messengers of meaning and translate concepts to tour-goers.  Symbolic interactionism captured the symbiotic nature of the interpretive process carried out on tours, as docents’ perceptions and role changes as a result of time, experience, and interactions with tour-goers. The study offers a view into the world of volunteer adult educators who work in the nonformal education setting of museums. Trained by the museum and responsible for educating museum visitors, tour-goers are entrusted with docents to learn about museums’ collections on walking tours through the galleries.\r\n     Utilizing a basic interpretive research design, the study offers understanding into how educators teach in nonformal settings, explains about how tours vary by docent, helps docent trainers and museum administrators understand how docents perform interpretation, and offers two conceptual frameworks for future research in the field of interpretation. Data collection was completed through observation and semi-structured interviews. Fourteen participants came from four different art museums in northeastern United States. \r\n     The study contributes to the fields of adult education, museum education, and interpretation. First, participants delivered an individualized tour that demonstrated their dedication to their role and to the institution. Second, docents threw light upon foreign objects or made them clear to tour-goers in a number of ways. Third, docents projected their horizon of meaning based on a number of tour-goer related factors in an effort to create a tailored educational interaction. Fourth, the outcomes docents hoped to achieve for themselves and tour-goers were described. \r\n     Findings speak to the purposefulness of these adult educators in interpreting art objects to tour-goers. The theoretical frameworks do not completely explain the intentional actions docents made to solicit reactions by and engagement with tour-goers. Participants demonstrated the theory of constructivism on tours, but some interpretive techniques from the transmission model of learning, such as storytelling, were practiced. The unbounded nature of the content may explain some of the constructivist tendencies. The current model of nonformal education could be expanded.\r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"ABSTRACT\r\nThis dissertation is founded on the assumption that social support is a valuable interpersonal resource that can vary in terms of its quality and efficacy for both support providers and receivers. The goal of this study is to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the social support process by investigating the manner in which personal, relational, and contextual qualities influence the production and reception of different social support messages. \r\nAs a starting point, Chapter 1 defines some of the key concepts in this dissertation. Namely, social support is introduced and reasons are established for its continued study. The remainder of this chapter discusses computer-mediated communication as a distinct communication channel with implications for the study and process of social support. \r\nChapter 2 provides a more detailed conceptualization and review of research on social support with a concentration on verbal person-centeredness. Verbal person-centered (VPC) messages exist within a theoretical hierarchy that describes message features that are likely to produce more or less beneficial supportive outcomes. This dissertation concentrates on the three main levels of the VPC hierarchy: low person-centered, medium person-centered, and highly person-centered messages. Given their pervasiveness in published research, this chapter also examines sex differences in the provision and reception of social support messages.\r\nIn Chapter 3, computer-mediated communication (CMC) is considered as a novel channel for the enactment of comforting interactions. This chapter reviews the research that has been conducted related to social support online and makes predictions about how social support is expected to unfold in CMC given the assumptions of several theories of mediated interpersonal communication. This chapter also describes a preference for online social interaction as an individual difference thought to influence people’s experiences of interpersonal CMC. Consistent with the research, theory, and variables reviewed to this point, hypotheses specify the influence of personal, relational, and contextual variables on support providers’, receivers’, and third party observers’ impressions of supportive interactions. \r\nChapter 4 describes an experiment designed to test the influence of several moderating variables on people’s perceptions of supportive interactions. This chapter begins by describing the procedures, participants, and research design of this experiment. This project involved randomly assigning male and female participants to dyads that engaged in conversations about a personal stressor experienced by one of the participants. One participant identified a personally distressing topic to talk about, and the other participant was designated the support provider. Support providers were trained to provide one of the three main levels of person-centered support. Participants then enacted a conversation via an online or face-to-face channel. Research participants completed Internet-based surveys before and after their interactions to measure a number of personal qualities and perceptions of their conversations. Finally, this chapter summarizes the self-reported and rated variables used to test the hypotheses proposed in Chapter 3. \r\nThe results of this study are described in Chapter 5. Results provide support for the hyperpersonal perspective of mediated interaction because participants were able to create effective interactions online. I also observed gender differences in message production and reception. Men assigned to the highly person-centered condition experienced the greatest benefit from conducting their supportive interactions online, such that they perceived greater communicative efficacy producing comforting messages online than face-to-face. In contrast, a preference for online social interaction exerted little influence on people’s perceptions of supportive interactions.\r\nFinally, Chapter 6 reviews the results presented in Chapter 5 and articulates the implications of this study for a theory of verbal person-centered social support and the continued study of social support in mediated contexts. Limitations of this study and benefits of using an experimental research design to study verbal person-centered social support are also discussed. The chapter concludes by proposing some directions for future research in the study of social support across face-to-face and CMC communication channels. \r\n\r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"Abolitionist John Brown is a divisive figure in United States history. He features prominently in our national historical narrative, but his radical politics, religious fanaticism, and violent methods have led to polarized memories of his contributions to the abolitionist cause and his role in the coming of the U.S. Civil War. Some consider Brown a hero or a martyr of abolitionism, while others view him as a violent extremist, even a madman. Over time, Americans from across the political spectrum have mobilized Brown’s memory to advance particular political and social causes, sometimes on opposing sides of the same issue. \r\n\r\nThis thesis examines three instances of public controversy over the memory of John Brown. In each of these case studies, Brown’s public memory has been rhetorically constructed and vigorously contested. First, I explore a controversy over regionalist painter John Steuart Curry’s depiction of Brown in the Kansas Statehouse mural, The Tragic Prelude. Some Kansans praised the mural for highlighting their state’s radical past, while others were offended that Curry would link Kansas history with the life of a murderous madman. I argue that The Tragic Prelude acted as a site for these Kansans to contest their state’s identity and its place in the larger narrative of Civil War history. Second, I will examine Brown’s first appearance on the silver screen in the 1940 Hollywood film, Santa Fe Trail. I argue that this film re-envisioned the coming of the Civil War, casting Brown as a stereotypical Western villain. In the process, Santa Fe Trail oversimplified the complex coming-of-the-Civil War narrative, blaming the war almost entirely on Brown, and implying that it might have been avoided were it not for Brown’s religious delusions and fanatical behaviors. Finally, I analyze a 1959 controversy over if and how the centennial of Brown’s Harpers Ferry raid should be commemorated. Although Brown’s raid was eventually remembered on its hundredth anniversary, the planners of the event took care to avoid celebrating the raid, especially in ways that might be taken as an endorsement of Brown’s radicalism or of his violence. I argue that in the social and political context of the time, this rejection of Brown—and of the liberal, abolitionist principles for which he stood—functioned simultaneously as an expression of Cold War distaste for “radicalism” and as a repudiation of one of the historical memories underlying the civil rights movement. \r\n\r\nUltimately, these three case studies show how, when Brown’s memory is invoked and contested, it typically has more to do with the politics of the moment than with discovering the “truth” of the past. John Brown serves as an ideal vehicle for articulating public memories because he embodies such important moral quandaries. Thus, a study of his public memories lends insights into how Americans confront issues such as the morality of slavery, the justifications for violence, and the “lessons” of the Civil War. \r\n\r\n",

Furthermore, the division of responsibilities in some emergency operations centers requires that the models of the environment must be built within a technology-based data system simultaneously as situational awareness is sought by the various human users of the system. The combination of these efforts can become especially trying at times where messages arrive at an increased pace – which coincide with times where quality decision-making becomes more crucial. This investigation evaluates the utility of three inter-modal user interface variants for supporting the interpretation of audio messages and for sustaining situational awareness. Human-subject experimental results indicate that subtle changes in user interface composition can have significant impacts on the performances of users in respects to their interpretation speed, accuracy, and situational awareness. This research is inspired by the operations of emergency response command and control centers as environmental complexity increases through atypical levels. The term “inter-modal” refers to the receipt of messages describing changes in the environment in an audio format, which must be interpreted and refined by users in order to be entered into a digital database via a traditional computer keyboard-video-mouse interface. &#8195;\r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"Mastitis is a common contributing factor to the relatively high pre-weaning mortality rate and suboptimal sow-reared piglet growth performance experienced in pork production.  An endotoxin challenge model of mastitis was used to determine its effects on sow milk composition, milk yield, and the growth of nursing piglets.  Caseins (beta-casein in particular), lactoferrin, and immunoglobulins, as determined by SDS-PAGE and ELISA, were high in colostrum, and levels decreased to mature levels by about day four of a normal lactation.  As mammary secretions changed from colostrum to milk, decreasing levels of chloride and albumin provided evidence for the closure of tight junctions by about day four of a normal lactation.  Following endotoxin infusion to induce mammary inflammation, sow rectal temperatures peaked at 1.1-1.7 degrees C above baseline by five hours post-infusion, and gradually recovered within 12-24 h.  Milk TNF-alpha was increased 30-fold by five hours post-infusion (serum TNF-alpha appeared to increase); both recovered by 12 h.  Milk total protein (20 %), albumin (44 %), and chloride (two-fold) were increased, and milk alpha s- and beta-casein (45 %) were decreased post-infusion; milk protein composition was altered for at least 48-60 h.  It did not appear that lactoferrin in milk responded to intramammary endotoxin infusion.  Hourly milk yields of infused mammary glands were decreased 16-31 % relative to control glands and the ADG of piglets nursing infused glands were decreased 44-74 % relative to littermates nursing control glands on the day of endotoxin infusion.  The ADG of piglets nursing infused glands remained decreased relative to littermates nursing control glands for at least five days post-infusion.  The apparent conversion of milk to live weight gain of pigs nursing infused glands was decreased relative to those nursing control glands.  Intramammary endotoxin infusion in the sow alters milk composition and depresses piglet growth performance for at least three to five days after the resolution of clinical signs of mammary inflammation.  This research demonstrates the impact of a mild inflammatory episode on pig production, and highlights the need for supplemental feeding of piglets at risk.",

Memory consolidation has shown improvement over time between practice sessions in certain motor tasks.  This study investigated the effect of practice trial and practice session interval distribution on adaptive warm-up effects at the beginning of a practice session and persistent learning effects over practice sessions.

        "abstract_tesi":"Abstract \r\nThis study expands the concept of reframing memory through reconciliation and revision by tracing the genealogy of a liminal supernatural entity (what I term the fantastic spirit and hereafter denote as FS) through works including Ovid’s Narcissus \r\nand Echo (AD 8), Dante Alighieri’s Vita Nuova (1292-1300), Yokomitsu Riichi’s Haru wa Basha ni notte (1915), Miyazawa Kenji’s Ginga tetsudo no yoru (1934), and James \r\nJoyce’s The Dead (1914). This comparative analysis differentiates, synthesizes, and advances upon conventional conceptions of the fantastic spirit narrative. What emerges \r\nis an understanding of how fantastic spirit narratives have developed and how their changes reflect conceptions of identity, alterity, and spirituality. Whether the afterlife is imagined as spatial relocation, transformation of consciousness, transformation of body, or hallucination, the role of the fantastic spirit is delineated by the degree to which it elicits a more profound relationship between the Self and Other. This increased participation is often precipitated by a creative renewal of faith derived from belief in FSs. Depending upon the culture-specific trope, the influence of the FS is markedly \r\ndifferent. Ghost, apparition, spectre, and obake are conventionally interchangeable concepts, yet they each articulate a unique reality. The ghost is a disembodied spirit, the \r\napparition is a transformed spirit with a transformed body, the spectre is related to the perception of the protagonist (e.g., a possible hallucination), and the obake is a changed \r\nobject. From the original Freudian idea of the uncanny, I argue that the FS narrative’s bracketing of culture-specific issues of alterity and identity has diversified from an enclosed gothic paradigm to a dialogic encounter, influenced by modernity, that is structurally versus historically based. The authors studied here incorporate and innovate traditional spiritual structures in their personal narratives. The result is a new role for the cultural imaginary. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"This study builds on education abroad, global citizenship and academic development literatures by assessing the extent to which embedding brief international travel experiences into residentially-taught courses enhances academic development and promotes global citizenship. Such faculty-led, education abroad programs are referred to as embedded programs. Grounded in Transformative Learning Theory, the study addressed two primary research questions: 1.) to what extent does participation in embedded education abroad programming mediate changes in students’ global citizenship, and thereby, social responsibility, global competence and global civic engagement; and, 2.) to what extent does participation in embedded education abroad programming enhance academic development, specifically with regard to academic self-concept and academic self-efficacy? A quasi-experimental study utilizing a nonequivalent control group design was employed to address these questions. Statistically reliable and valid scales were developed to measure academic development and global citizenship. The results show that the embedded and match courses varied with regard to their overall mean scores for global citizenship and academic development and in the pattern with which they change over time. Students in the embedded courses had significantly higher pre-test and post-test mean scores for both global citizenship and academic development. Both samples showed positive increases in global citizenship over time, but only the students in the match courses showed significant change. Neither sample showed overall positive change toward academic development, but students in the embedded courses did show increases in academic self-efficacy.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the study scrutinized widely-held assumptions of the traditional education abroad student profile by more accurately accounting for previously underrepresented or unacknowledged populations. In particular, the study focused on the extent to which financial need, first-generation status, and heritage impact education abroad choice and in what ways these and others populations participate in education abroad programming. To do so, a comprehensive, four-year enrollment analysis of all degree-seeking Pennsylvania State University students who studied abroad in academic years 2005/06, 2006/07, 2007/08, and 2008/09 was conducted.  The findings show that education abroad program type does in fact appeal differently to particular student populations. Males, minorities, first-generation, non-traditional students, and those with greater financial need are disproportionately represented in embedded programs.  \r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"This dissertation examines how language and culture are performed in a corpus of selected television cooking show discourse from Romania and the US.  More specifically, this study offers a micro- and macro-level linguistic analysis of two television cooking shows from the US, 30 Minute Meals and The Essence of Emeril, and two from Romania, The Recipe from Home and I Eat Therefore I Am; both the US and the Romanian television corpus include one male and one female host.  The US shows are among the most popular cooking programs on contemporary television, while the Romanian shows constitute the first food programs ever produced in Romanian. \r\nThe present study is the first linguistic anthropological study that investigates how culture and stance-taking, or socio-culturally determined attitudes, are constituted in television cooking show discourse.  Drawing on scholarly work from anthropology (e.g., Mannheim and Tedlock, 1995), sociology (Bourdieu, 1997; 1990; 1991), and linguistic anthropology (Ochs & Schieffelin, 1989; Besnier, 1990; Kärkkäinen, 2006; Du Bois, 2007), I argue that culture and stance are intrinsically connected, and that a nuanced understanding of US and Romanian cultural frames expressed in cooking show discourse requires an analysis of stance-taking linguistic features.  In this dissertation, I focus on two types of discursive stance-taking, affective stance (Ochs, 1996) and interactional stance (Kärkkäinen, 2006; Du Bois, 2007), and on how they both reflect and construct cultural patterns in television cooking show discourse.   \r\nMore specifically, using Ochs’ (1996) and Silverstein’s (2003) indexicality principle, I analyze affective stances towards taste and their indexical meanings in television cooking show discourse to understand cross-linguistic and cross-cultural differences and similarities, as well as gender-specific characteristics of affective stance towards taste in this media genre.  I also appeal to Goffman’s constructs of the presentation of self (Goffman, 1959), frame analysis (Goffman, 1974), and footing (Goffman, 1981), to examine stance and interaction in television cooking show discourse from the two countries, and how such interactions point to the construction of several host roles.  Lastly, I use Silverstein’s indexical order (2003) concept to understand how particular instantiations of stance, taste, affect, and interaction in the selected corpus have meaning within the broader Romanian and US cultural context.  \r\nAs the first discourse-analytic study on Romanian media, and the only discourse- analytic study of television cooking show discourse in the US, this analysis contributes to a more nuanced understanding of how everyday discursive patterns (in this case, via the medium of television) relate to cultural patterns in general, and those in Romanian and US cultures in particular.  For instance, this study provides evidence not only of differences with regard to affect and interaction between US and Romanian cultures—consistent with traditional “contrastive” or dichotomous views of the differences between Western and Eastern cultures--but also illustrates discursive similarities between the two sets of cultural artifacts, that call for re-examination and questioning of such dichotomous schemata. Furthermore, this dissertation study illustrates the creation of cultural personae of television cooking show hosts through micro- and macro-level linguistic features, and shows how their popularity is at least partly a feature of their stance-taking process towards taste, affect, and interaction.  \r\n",

As geovisualization tools evolve to support more sophisticated analytical capabilities, the results that emerge from these systems are becoming more abundant and intricate. Current tools provide basic mechanisms for collecting, organizing, and making sense out of multiple results, but little basic research has been done to characterize this task – the synthesis of geovisual information.\r\n\r\nThis study explores the topic of synthesis in the context of infectious disease surveillance. Expert analysts from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) and experts from the Penn State Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics (CIDD), and the Geographic Visualization Science, Technology, and Applications Center (GeoVISTA) were recruited to take part in interviews and experiments to characterize geovisual synthesis. These participants are likely to use, or are already using geovisualization tools to develop analytical results – therefore they stand to benefit from new synthesis support tools. \r\n\r\nThis research employs a mixed qualitative method study to characterize and design for geovisual synthesis. Interviews were conducted with analysts at PNNL to characterize how synthesis is conducted currently and to elicit opinions about how synthesis should be supported in the future. Individual and collaborative synthesis experiments were conducted with participants from PNNL, CIDD, and GeoVISTA to observe synthesis in a simulated real-world scenario. Analysis of experimental and interview data provides insight into the process of geovisual synthesis. Results show that synthesis involves the application of a wide range of organizational metaphors, and that it requires flexible tools that support creative approaches. These results are distilled into a set of empirically-derived design guidelines for new synthesis support tools.\r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has gained tremendous popularity among medical practitioners in a variety of disciplines.  The introduction and development of laparoscopy in the late 20$^{th}$ century proved that MIS could be implemented safely and effectively.  Laparoscopy provided both an effective alternative to traditional open surgery as well as benefits including reductions in patient recovery time, pain, probability of infection, and cosmetic scaring.  In a similar fashion, a developing endoscopic MIS technique called Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES) has the potential to provide surgical alternatives which completely eliminate the need for external incisions, resulting in obvious patient care benefits.  \r\n\r\nPerformance of the endoscopic tools used during endoscopic and NOTES procedures is extremely limited by strict size constraints, thereby significantly impeding the development of experimental MIS procedures.  The focus of this work is the design, analysis, and testing of a multifunctional 3.0 mm diameter endoscopic forceps for use in MIS.  Models of the proposed design predict considerable improvements in opening range and force application for both grasping and spreading when compared to currently used endoscopic forceps.  Electrocautery ability is also provided to increase tool utility; studies are conducted to evaluate cautery performance relative to commercial products.  In addition to possessing multifunctional grasping, spreading, and cautery abilities, the tool's design promotes fail-safe malfunctions, including locking prior to failure and a decreased likelihood of part fracture.  In order to increase tool utility, a means of providing articulation ability to the tool is investigated.  Increased instrument dexterity is desirable for manipulation of tissue in remote regions, but size constraints prevent practical implementation of dextrous endoscopic tools.  A practical means of classifying dextrous manipulators is presented and used to evaluate the potential for scalability to the meso level (1-5 mm diameter).  A compliant design which provides articulation ability at the meso scale is introduced and evaluated based on practical efficacy.  Results of this evaluation indicate that the concept possesses potential for articulation ability.\r\n\r\nExperimental endoscopic procedures often necessitate unique tool performance requirements which currently available tools do not meet.  Scaling current tool concepts to the meso level often results in significant performance losses, thereby hindering the development of novel medical procedures.  The work detailed in this thesis aims to provide increased surgical capabilities to surgeons during endoscopic procedures.",

        "abstract_tesi":"First, this study sought to generate and critically analyze a concise, systematic and rigorous multi-method approach to future-oriented competency modeling. The next phase involved using this hybrid methodology to develop a model that will profile exemplary business market managers using a prospective naturalistic inquiry methodology. This research was conducted using a modified Delphi technique where the initial Delphic instrument was created using a literature review, interviews and expert review panels.\r\nAgreement within the groups was measured for each competency in order to assess levels of consensus, differences within the groups were measured to identify controversial competencies and inter-rater reliability was measured to assess the consistency of the ratings. Competencies were clustered in order of importance and a competency “kernel” was identified. The Delphi panelists were selected using a purposive non-probabilistic dual-stage stratified sampling technique mixed with a snowball approach. The subjects represented three continents and a wide range of expertise.\r\nThe design of the competency model entailed three main steps: construction, de-construction and reconstruction. In the construction phase, 153 competencies were identified, arranged into 17 functional clusters and rated. Using the quantitative data, the model was deconstructed and its various parts examined. It was later reconstructed based on the results of the analysis. Since a large number of competencies were identified, the data were analyzed and broken down into a series of “perspectives” with more manageable “chunks” of data.\r\nIn an attempt to provide a more holistic view of the data, an emergent model based on the six strata of the 102 “core” competencies was synthesized. Two additional expositions were offered: (1) in the second adaptation of the model, the 102 core competencies were broken down and reanalyzed to synthesize the “Emergent Functional Model” (EFM). The third synthesis of the model, the “Emergent Systems Model” (ESM) was exploratory and sought to depict the interdependencies and relationships that exist between the core competencies. This holistic perspective of the business-to-business market management competencies was built based on concepts borrowed from systems theory and cybernetics (first and second order). The EFM and the ESM blur the line between individual and organizational competencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"   The relationship between the microstructure and tensile ductility and fracture toughness for cast Ti-5111 was determined and compared to that of hot-rolled and annealed Ti-5111.  Graphite mold cast Ti-5111 plate material was examined in the as-received condition and after six different heat treatments involving elevated temperature anneals followed by an air or furnace cool.  Three investment cast Ti-5111 plates were also examined after annealing followed by either a fan cool, air cool, or furnace cool.  All castings developed a lamellar colony microstructure consisting of aligned lamellae of alpha and beta phases.  Altering the cooling rate from the annealing temperature had the most influence on the microstructure such that plates with a slower cooling rate typically developed coarser grain boundary alpha, larger alpha colonies, thicker alpha laths, and greater volume fractions of alpha phase.   The average prior beta grain size for the graphite mold cast specimens ranged from 920 µm to 1360 µm, while that for the investment cast specimens was approximately 1750 µm.  \r\n   The tensile behavior of the castings was characterized by a crack initiation and propagation process where the ductility was often limited by the strain required to initiate a large crack.  The cracks formed along planar slip bands that crossed alpha colonies or in some cases, entire prior beta grains.  Thus, reducing the alpha colony size and prior beta grain size should improve the casting ductility by limiting the length of slip-induced cracks.  Due to the large grain and colony sizes present in the castings, the strength and ductility was observed to be sensitive to specimen size such that a smaller tensile diameter (i.e. 3.2 mm as compared to 12.5 mm) decreased the tensile and yield strengths due to the high fraction of large grains located on the specimen surface that can yield by predominantly single slip.  The scatter in ductility values in the smaller specimens was significantly greater as a result of fracture controlled by a crack initiation and propagation process within a single grain that comprises a large fraction of the specimen cross-section.  Thus, once a large crack initiated, minimal additional strain was required to propagate the crack.  \r\n   Both intrinsic and extrinsic toughening mechanisms were apparent in the fracture toughness study of the castings.  The fracture initiation toughness was enhanced by secondary cracking and significant blunting at the crack tip as evidenced by the presence of strain-induced void formation within a large process zone.  Large alpha colonies located at the transition between the fatigue pre-crack and tensile crack growth regions limited the fracture initiation toughness by promoting easy crack growth along a significant fraction of the crack front.  Thus, limiting the alpha colony size should enhance the fracture initiation toughness.  \r\n   The best crack propagation resistance (tearing modulus) was observed from specimens with large alpha colonies and large prior beta grains.  Enhancing the size of these features increased the surface roughness, and consequently the tearing modulus, due to greater crack deflection, crack bifurcation, and shear ligament toughening from the larger alpha colonies and prior beta grains.  Crack bridging by the ductile beta phase was also observed and should enhance the tearing modulus. When compared to the hot-rolled and annealed plate, the graphite mold castings exhibited better fracture initiation toughness and crack propagation resistance. However, the wrought plate maintained relatively good fracture initiation toughness and crack propagation resistance as a result of the continuous ductile beta matrix present in the microstructure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

To accomplish such a goal, self-report measures, a bistable figure perceptual task, and neuropsychological tests were used.  First, the relationship between attention and dissociation was examined.  There were no observed differences between high and low dissociators on a measure of selective attention and a continuous performance task.\r\nThe relationship between dissociation and visual perception was also examined.  There were no significant differences between the high and low dissociators’ number of perceptual shifts on a bistable figure task.  Further, both high and low dissociators were able to voluntarily control the reversals.  These results lead us to believe that reversal rate and dissociative phenomena are orthogonal constructs.  The study also sought to explore the relationship between dissociation and the construct of executive functioning.  Self-report and neuropsychological measures assessing different aspects of executive functioning were used.  It was found that, although highly dissociative individuals report more executive difficulties than low dissociative individuals, these relative difficulties do not show up on their performance on any of the neuropsychological measures of executive functioning.  Further investigation of dissociative processes and cognitive functioning is undoubtedly warranted.  Future research should also continue to investigate the relationship between dissociative phenomena and executive functioning as measured by self-report and by neuropsychological measures, perhaps using more ecologically valid tests of executive functioning.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Human trafficking is a form of modern-day slavery that, while mainly hidden from the public eye, numerically rivals antebellum slavery.  Anti-trafficking efforts have been adopted globally to curb this growing phenomenon, yet many international communities have failed to put these initiatives into practice.  To this end, the U.S. Department of State implemented the Trafficking in Persons Report to monitor and increase anti-trafficking efforts worldwide.  The current study employs an interrupted time-series design to determine the efficacy of this policy initiative.  The research also identifies predictors of anti-trafficking initiatives and U.S. targeted grants to foster an evidence-based approach to fund efforts that reduce the trafficking in persons.  Limitations and policy implications are discussed.\r\n\r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"Cooperative education (co-op) and internships are forms of experiential education that allow students to complement their classroom experiences with work experience. This study examines the influence of co-op and internships on engineering problem-solving skills by answering the following research questions: 1) Does experience in cooperative education or internship programs influence students' self-perceptions of their engineering problem-solving skills? 2) How do students with cooperative education or internship experience differ in their perception and understanding of their engineering problem-solving skills as compared to students with no experience?\r\n\r\n  The design of this study included a quantitative and a qualitative component.  I conducted a quantitative analysis to answer the first research question utilizing multivariate regression and multi-nominal logit models to examine whether significant differences existed between students with engineering work experience and students with no engineering work experience with regard to assessments of their 1) basic skills, 2) design and problem-solving skills, and 3) engineering thinking skills. The key variables came from a set of three scales and their respective items from the nationally representative Engineering Change (EC2000) dataset, which contains survey responses from 4,461 senior engineering students from the class of 2004 in seven engineering disciplines (aerospace, chemical, computer, electrical, industrial, and mechanical) from 39 accredited institutions.\r\n\r\n  The second research question was addressed through qualitative data collection and analysis. I interviewed three groups of senior electrical engineering students at a single research I university: 1) students who completed three rotations in the co-op program, 2) students who completed at least one internship, and 3) students who completed neither co-op nor internship. In total, I interviewed 17 undergraduate engineering students, including 1) four students who completed at least three cooperative education rotations, 2) eight students who completed at least one internship, and 3) five students who completed neither cooperative education nor internship.\r\nThe quantitative analysis indicates that students who spent more time in a cooperative education or internship program rate their understanding of engineering problem-solving more highly than those who have not participated in such programs. The more time spent in these work-related experiences, the more highly students rated their understanding of essential aspects of the engineering design process, and their abilities to apply systematic design procedure to open-ended problem; design solutions to meet desired needs; ensure that a process or product meets a variety of technical and practical criteria; and compare and judge alternative outcomes.\r\n \r\n  The qualitative analysis suggested that students' classroom and work (co-op and internship) experiences differentially influenced three types of knowledge: theoretical, practical, and procedural knowledge. “Theoretical knowledge” refers to the theories, laws and principles of the field. The majority of the students reported that classroom experiences in solving textbook problems helped them develop this type of knowledge. Students with work experience described how their work assignments often required them to consider contextual factors as well as technical ones when solving problems on the job. This kind of “practical knowledge” encouraged students to address a variety of relevant factors when solving problems. They contended that these contextual factors were not always prominent in classroom assignments or homework problems. Finally, “procedural knowledge” can be defined as knowledge of how to solve problems.  When comparing the groups, students with co-op and internship experiences were more likely to understand the importance of problem-solving processes (such as defining the problem or applying systematic procedures) than students without work experience.\r\n \r\n  The findings from both the qualitative and quantitative components of the study are consistent. The quantitative analysis showed that time spent in a co-op or internship was significant for the majority of survey items related to procedural knowledge but not significant for items related to theoretical knowledge. This aligns with the findings from the interviews. Co-op and internship students reported that their work experience taught them that in order to succeed on the job, they needed to develop both procedural knowledge and theoretical knowledge. Procedural knowledge gained through engagement in engineering practice at a co-op or internship increased students’ confidence in their problem-solving ability.\r\n\r\n  Understanding how cooperative education and internship program influences students' perception of their engineering problem-solving skills has practical implications. For curricular designers, knowing how individuals perceive their different types of knowledge necessary to solve problems allows for a more intentional design of curricular and co-curricular activities to develop students’ competency within an academic domain. I recommend curricular designers focus on strengthening and enhancing students’ theoretical knowledge, practical knowledge, procedural knowledge through classroom activities such as writing assignments that ask students to explain their problem-solving process. Program-level recommendations include incorporating more project-based or lab-like courses into the curriculum, so students have more opportunities to actively engage in solving real-world problems. Future research should examine the long-term effects of co-op and internship programs on students' perception of engineering problem-solving skills once they have graduated and worked in the profession.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"Global temperature increases of 0.6 oC over the past century and predicted increases of 2o to 6 oC over the next century have prompted many studies on effects of global warming on the population dynamics of plants and animals. Studies of landbirds in Europe and North America have shown effects of climatic variation on productivity and survival. However, such effects have been seen to translate to changes in population densities in only a few studies of European landbirds. Thus, the extent to which global warming has the potential to cause population declines in North American landbirds has remained unclear. In the research presented here, I model 39 years of climatic data, including indices of the North Atlantic Oscillation and El NinÞo Southern Oscillation, and distribution-wide Breeding Bird Survey data on 21 North American landbird species, to examine potential relationships between large-scale climate change and changes in avian population densities. Results of these analyses indicate geographic variation in strength of the effect of climate on population densities, with stronger effects in regions in which climate has stronger effects on local temperatures. Results also indicate that for species exhibiting long-term declines, there is a relationship between strength of the effect of local temperatures on population densities and magnitude of population decline. Additional analyses indicate that Neotropical-Nearctic migratory species are more negatively affected by warm winter temperatures than are closely-related North American residents. These results support the hypothesis that differences in climatic effects on migrants and residents may follow from greater trophic mismatch for species that are unable to time migration in response to earlier peaks in food availability. Finally, results of this work show that species are more highly affected by densities of sympatric congeners in areas in which they are also affected by climate, indicating that increased effects of climate on food resources may increase the effects of competition between congeners. Overall, results of this research indicate that North American landbird densities are affected by annual changes in large-scale climate, such that continued increases in global temperatures have the potential to affect long-term changes in landbird population densities across the continent.\r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"\"Rhetoric for Becoming Otherwise\" begins with the Isocratean premise that thought, speech, writing are best understood as bridges between the already said of language and the emerging circumstances that are the occasions for their production.  This argument is rehearsed across a variety of domains and instances following Isocrates exhortation that the rhetorician or practitioner of philosophia can only model the movement of discourse without expecting to provide any “true knowledge” or “absolute theory” for how to encounter the problematics of an endlessly deferred present.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of rhetoric, becoming otherwise is the continually renewed task of creating something new from the resources of language and for the demands of an ever deferred present—Presocratics versus Classicists (Chapter 1).   As a matter of health, becoming otherwise is the necessity of overcoming limitation and suffering in order to achieve new norms of health and pursue the ever changing opportunities of a self-developing capacity for producing new capacities—Normativity versus Normalization (Chapter 2).   In terms of literature, becoming otherwise is the diagnosis of constraint in the form of the orientations of habit and the contestation of the socializing force of all interpretive schemes as the means of multiplying possibilities for action—Countergridlock versus Gridlock (Chapter 3).  As genealogy, becoming otherwise requires the patient examination of the forces of the past that seek to colonize the future in order to discover new modes of ethical subjectivity for the present—the reoccurrence of the body and the repetition of its difference versus the rule of law and the right to desire (Chapter 4).  As an ecstatic practice, becoming otherwise is the affirmation of the impossible task of discovering a way through fields of force and lines of flight that offer no intelligibility outside of their unfolding paths of discovery and experimentation—sorcerers versus priests (Chapter 5).  Ultimately, my dissertation seeks to multiply and intensify available tools for navigating imbrications of power/knowledge, to map a series of ways through reactive formations of thought, to affirm the impossible task of becoming otherwise.",

        "abstract_tesi":"The rates of overweight and obesity in America continue to increase along with the need for effective dietary strategies that can help people to reduce energy intake, enhance satiety, and facilitate weight management. Research has suggested strategies such as consuming a high protein diet, reducing dietary energy density, or consuming pre-portioned meals to help lower energy intake. The literature testing these strategies, however, is either inconsistent or incomplete. A series of studies have been conducted that examine the effects of these strategies on energy intake in order to provide better recommendations for controlling energy intake. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of Study 1 was to determine whether increasing the protein content of meals reduced daily energy intake and enhanced satiety. The satiating effects of protein were investigated by varying the protein content of meals consumed ad libitum across a range of commonly consumed amounts over a day. In this crossover experiment, 18 normal-weight women consumed ad libitum lunch and dinner entrées one day a week that were covertly varied in protein content (10, 15, 20, 25, or 30% energy). Entrées were manipulated by substituting animal protein for starchy ingredients and were matched for energy density, fat content, palatability, and appearance. Unmanipulated breakfasts and evening snacks were consumed ad libitum. Participants rated their hunger and fullness before and after meals as well as the taste and appearance of entrées. Results showed that mean 24-hour protein intake increased significantly across conditions, from 44±2 g/d in the 10% protein condition to 82±6 g/d in the 30% condition. Daily energy intake, however, did not differ significantly across the 10% to 30% protein conditions (means 1870±93, 1887±93, 1848±111, 1876±100, and 1807±98 kcal). There were no significant differences in hunger and fullness ratings across conditions or in taste and appearance ratings of the manipulated entrées. \r\n\r\nStudy 2 tested the recommendation of substituting low-energy-dense foods (vegetables) for foods higher in energy density to reduce energy intake. Puréed vegetables were incorporated into entrées at multiple meals to decrease the energy density and the effects on daily energy and vegetable intakes were investigated. In this crossover study, 20 men and 21 women ate ad libitum breakfast, lunch, and dinner in the laboratory once a week for three weeks. Across conditions, entrées at meals were varied in energy density (100%, 85%, or 75%) by covertly incorporating 3 or 4.5 times the amount of puréed vegetables. Entrées were accompanied by unmanipulated side dishes. Participants rated their hunger and fullness before and after meals. The results showed that subjects consumed a consistent weight of food across conditions of energy density; thus, daily energy intake significantly decreased by 202±60 kcal in the 85% condition (p<0.001) and 357±47 kcal in the 75% condition (p<0.0001). Daily vegetable consumption significantly increased from 270±17 g in the 100% condition to 487±25 g in the 75% condition (p<0.0001). Despite differences in energy intake, ratings of hunger and fullness did not differ significantly across conditions. Entrées were rated similar in palatability across conditions.\r\n\r\nStudy 3 determined how the effects of energy density and energy content of pre-portioned entrées combine to influence daily energy intake. In a crossover design, 28 men and 40 women were provided with breakfast, lunch, and dinner on one day a week for 4 weeks. Each meal included a compulsory, manipulated pre-portioned entrée and a variety of unmanipulated discretionary foods that were consumed ad libitum. Across the 4 weeks, the entrées were varied in both energy density and energy content between a standard level (100%) and a reduced level (64%). In men, reducing both the energy density and the energy content of the pre-portioned entrées led to independent decreases in total meal energy intake (both p<0.01). A 36% decrease in energy density led to a 6% decrease in energy intake (154±46 kcal), and a 36% decrease in energy content led to an 11% decrease in energy intake (291±75 kcal). Thus, decreases in the energy density and energy content of pre-portioned entrées acted independently and added together to reduce total meal energy intake. Women showed similar effects on daily energy intake as men, however, this outcome was influenced by the interaction of energy density and energy content to reduce total meal energy intake (p<0.01). \r\n\r\nThe findings from these studies suggest that energy density plays a major role in the regulation of energy intake. When energy density is held constant, variations in the protein content of entrées consumed ad libitum are not likely to influence daily energy intake or affect ratings of satiety. On the other hand, variations in energy density lead to changes in energy intake and may influence satiety. One way to reduce energy density is by increasing the amount of vegetables or fruits in foods. Puréed vegetables can be incorporated into various sweet and savory foods in large amounts; a strategy that can not only reduce energy intake, but can also increase vegetable intake without increasing hunger. A reduction in energy intake can also be found when the fruit and vegetable content of pre-portioned entrées is increased. Furthermore, reducing the energy density in addition to reducing the energy content leads to further decreases energy intake while maintaining satiety. In summary, the results of these studies support the recommendation of decreasing energy density, but not increasing protein content, to reduce energy intake and make an impact on the growing rates of obesity. \r\n\r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"Charge transport properties of thin film organic solar cells are investigated using both integral time-of-flight (I-TOF) and charge extraction by linearly increasing voltage (CELIV) measurement techniques.  Test devices are constructed with active layers consisting of blended of poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl–C61–butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) in a glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/Al structure.  Samples are tested using voltages varying from 0 to 15V and light intensities from 2.5 to 600mW.  Characteristic voltage transients are obtained with each technique.  From experimental data, electron mobility in the P3HT:PCBM solar cell devices is found to be on the order of &#956;n = 5x10-4 cm2/Vs using I-TOF and &#956;n = 2x10-5 cm2/Vs using CELIV.  Both results are close to published data, with our I-TOF data being somewhere in the middle, and the CELIV results being slightly lower [1-5].\r\n\r\nIntegral TOF mobility results are probed as a function of collection capacitance, voltage, and light intensity.  No significant variation is seen for changing the capacitance or the light intensity, but changing voltage yields the intriguing negative mobility dependence which has been reported in literature [6].\r\n\r\nComparison between the two techniques is made.  The dielectric relaxation time is found to be fast while carrier lifetime is short (both relative to the transit time of carriers across the sample).  These indicate redistribution of the electric field and concentration near the contact regions, a violation which will cause I-TOF measurements to be overestimated [7].  This may explain why I-TOF values are higher than their CELIV counterparts.\r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"In order to stand upright, humans are required to overcome a series of challenges posed by the mechanical design of our body. The vertical orientation of the head-leg-trunk segments, high center of mass, large number of joints, and narrow base of support contribute to making the body mechanically unstable. We study multi-muscle synergies involved in the control of vertical posture. For most of the studies to be presented, we define synergies as task-specific organizations of elemental variables, which stabilize particular performance variables, in a sense of reducing their variability across repetitive trials. We use a computational method of identifying and analyzing muscle synergies, based on the uncontrolled manifold (UCM) hypothesis. UCM analysis is performed in the space of hypothetical elemental variables (M-modes) during repetitive or cyclic whole body tasks. As such, the analysis involves two steps. First, M-modes have to be identified over sets of trials at similar tasks with different parameters. Second, variance in the magnitude of the M-modes has to be analyzed with respect to particular performance variables over repetitive attempts at the same task. More specifically, we studied the multi-muscle coordination during the performance of cyclic whole-body voluntary movements (sway) in the anterior-posterior (AP) direction and production of the moment of force around the vertical axis of the body (MZ). Three studies were performed assuming the existence of at least two levels of control with synergies possible at each level. At the higher level, values or time profiles of specific mechanical variables (COP or MZ trajectory) are stabilized by covariation of magnitudes of M-modes. The hierarchically lower level is the level where M-modes are formed. This lower level ensures proportional involvement of muscles within a group; in other words, it defines the direction of an eigenvector in muscle activation space corresponding to a M-mode. The main findings of the studies are: (1) The UCM method allows to quantify multi-muscle synergies; (2) Postural muscles are united into a small set of M-modes similar across subjects and task parameters for simple sway tasks; (3) The number of significant M-modes and their composition change when the tasks are performed in more challenging condition; (4) Synergies stabilizing performance variables can be built on different sets of M-modes.\r\n",

The public availability of these networks has allowed researchers and businesses alike to delve more into these preferences so as to extract communities which clearly define their formation. In social networks, people tend to have more than one preference over different products which makes it difficult to put them in a single community. Although community detection has been well applied to social networks, not much work has been done in detecting overlapping communities within these networks. In this paper we describe an algorithm which applies a game theoretic approach to graph clustering to determine overlapping communities within complex networks and also show how a parallel implementation of the algorithm can be used to detect communities in lesser time than its previous implementations. Further we run the algorithm on various social networks to detect overlapping communities and propose a method to analyze them once they are determined. We conclude by providing impetus on the running time of this algorithm and expressing the need for faster algorithms to detect and analyze social media networks.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"The Ordovician was a time of extensive diversification and radiation of marine life. The end of the Ordovician is marked by a major mass extinction that is generally attributed to environmental perturbations associated with an extensive yet short-lived glaciation. The understanding of the climate dynamics during this crucial time period for the evolution of life is still fragmental.\r\nI used an atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) and an ocean general circulation model (OGCM) to study the climate system in the Caradoc (~454 Ma) and the Ashgill (~545 Ma). Specifically, I investigated the response to changes in paleogeography, atmospheric pCO2, solar insolation cycles (obliquity), poleward ocean heat transport, and sea level. I also used a 3-dimensional ice sheet model to explore the necessary boundary conditions for ice sheet formation.\r\nThe AGCM results indicate that, assuming that pCO2 did not fall below 8x PAL (a minimum value for this time period), a drop in pCO2 and the paleogeographic evolution can only be regarded as preconditioning factors in the glaciation. In order for ice sheets to form, other factors must have changed such as a drop in sea level from its generally high Late Ordovician levels and/or a reduction in poleward ocean heat transport.\r\nIn all OGCM simulations, a drop in sea level led to a reduction in poleward ocean heat transport.  This indicates a possible positive feedback that could have led to enhanced global cooling in response to pre-glaciation sea level drop. Continental drift could explain the observed global cooling trend in the Late Ordovician through a combined reduction in poleward ocean heat transport and increased ice-albedo effect. The ocean-climate system was also dominated by strong latitudinal temperature gradients and vigorous horizontal and vertical ocean circulation.\r\nFinally, I compared the paleobiogeography of different taxonomic groups to the results of the climate models. The spatial distribution of Caradocian marine organisms is consistent with climatic and oceanographic gradients inferred from coupled ocean-climate models. The paleobiogeographic data thus provide an important evaluation of the global ocean-climate models and lead to a more robust inference of the early Late Ordovician global ecosystem.\r\n",

Rule 10b5-1 includes a safe harbor provision that protects certain insiders from litigation associated with their trades.  Evidence suggests the safe harbor allows insiders a better opportunity to profit from trade, which is not consistent with the traditional concept of regulatory intent.  Specifically, evidence suggests participation is associated with: (1) insiders with greater personal litigation risk who likely have access to and control over disclosure of material nonpublic information; (2)   a large volume increase not fully explained by proxies for insiders’ diversification needs; (3) an increase in abnormal trade profits; and (4) more sales volume immediately before disclosure of negative management earnings forecasts than immediately after disclosure.  \r\nThis thesis also examines firms’ voluntary decision to disclose insiders’ participation within Rule 10b5-1 to provide evidence of the costs and benefits associated with this disclosure choice.  Evidence suggests firms disclose this information to reduce litigation costs and to reduce stock price volatility related to disclosure of insider trade activity.  Specifically, disclosure is positively associated with firm size, a proxy for a firm’s litigation risk, and with a measure of the firm’s price sensitivity to disclosure of insiders’ trades.  Evidence also suggests that insiders prefer that disclosure not occur, perhaps because disclosure reduces potential trade profits.  Disclosure is positively associated with a variable capturing insiders’ influence over the board of directors interacted with both the firm’s price sensitivity to disclosure of insiders’ trades and the level of insider trading volume.\r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"In this thesis I explore the dynamics of infectious diseases in rodents. Using Sin Nombre hantavirus (SNV) in deer mice as a model system and a combination of mark-recapture analysis and mathematical models, I explore how infectious diseases can affect individuals, populations and communities, and analyze population, community, and ecosystem level patterns in disease dynamics. I also explore the effect of infectious disease on evolutionary histories, specifically, how bacterial infection may have shaped mammalian hibernation patterns. I use a combination of statistical analysis of longterm data and mathematical models to understand observed ecological patterns and improve our ability to forecast dynamics. \r\n     Microparasites can have a number of effects on individuals, populations, and communities. I explore the effect of SNV on the deer mouse host and what effect this may have on the host population dynamics and persistence of the disease in the population. I find that SNV decreases survival of antibody positive male deer mice by 15.4\\%. This can affect both the host population dynamics, by leading to regulation of the host population, as well as the population-level patterns seen in SNV infection, by increasing the critical host density and making the chain of transmission more likely to be broken.\r\n     Since the host population dynamics can be affected by many intrinsic and extrinsic factors, such as environmental forcing, disturbance, availability of resources, competition, and other food web interactions, these can all have strong influences on the persistence and spread of a pathogen in the host population. I quantitatively evaluate the proposed bottom-up trophic cascade hypothesis to explain the original SNV outbreak, using 15 years of data from Montana. I show that mouse population dynamics in Montana are strongly correlated to precipitation and temperature with a 0 to 5 month lag. These changing environmental conditions alter the carrying capacity of the environment, which can lead to delayed density dependence in prevalence of the virus (with a lag of up to 16 months or more) in the mouse population and intermittent crossing of the critical host density necessary for hantavirus endemicity. My work helps shed some light on the notoriously difficult to understand dynamics of the virus, such as seemingly inverse density dependence in prevalence and sporadic disappearance of the virus from local populations. Since there is no effective treatment or vaccine for HPS, the most effective strategy is to take preventative measures. This quantitative understanding of the lags between environmental conditions and prevalence of the virus may allow us advance warning (up to 20 months or more) of increased risk to humans.",

        "abstract_tesi":"Creating gender equity in engineering education is important for more reasons than simply being a matter of social justice or diversifying the engineering field. It is also a significant educational and public policy issue that will affect the future economic competitiveness of the United States in the global marketplace. Engineering is arguably the leading national example of a profession in which women are under-represented. Undergraduate engineering programs not only need to attract and retain female students, but they must also provide full access to the educational experiences women must have to develop the engineering skills to succeed in the engineering profession. \r\n\r\nThis study explored whether the shift to the “soft” or less technical skills in engineering encouraged by new accreditation standards could potentially have had differential effects for women in engineering from their male counterparts. In particular, this study examined the proposition that program practices and policies, faculty members’ activities, and the experiences of engineering students in college, affect the learning of female students differently than that of male students. The three engineering skills chosen for this study were students’ development of design skills, group skills, and awareness of societal and global issues. Data for this study came from a nationally representative sample of engineering program graduates who received their degrees in 1994 (n = 5,335) and 2004 (n = 4,158), 1,243 faculty, and 147 program chairs at 39 different institutions. This study relied on secondary analysis of data from the Engineering Change study, which assessed changes in student learning associated with the implementation of the new Engineering Criteria 2000 (EC2000) accreditation standards. \r\n\r\nThe findings from the current study shed light on the complexity of the processes at work in female and male students’ learning and the importance of creating models that can guide research on both male and female students’ development and change while in college. Changes in program and faculty activities affected both students’ experiences and their learning, and those effects differed by gender. This study also revealed that students’ in- and out-of-class experiences differed significantly in their influence on female and male students’ development of selected engineering abilities. For learning that occurs in engineering programs, and perhaps many other professional and academic fields, gender seems to moderate the effects of programmatic and faculty activities, as well as the influences of students’ undergraduate experiences. \r\n\r\nIt is important for faculty and administrators to understand the differences in learning by women and men in order to identify the best ways to produce female graduates with the skills needed in the workplace (Baxter Magolda, 1992). More needs to be done in engineering education than just helping women to adapt to a traditionally masculine field (Salminen-Karlsson, 2002). Responding to individual students’ needs at each level of learning can strengthen the overall educational experience in and outside of the classroom (Baxter Magolda, 1992). After identifying gender patterns in development and learning, the significant differences reveal that males and females may need different challenges and support systems to ensure their future skill levels. In particular, faculty members can stress applied skills to positively affect female students’ abilities to problem-solve and design solutions, and also use active learning pedagogies in their classes to encourage female students to develop their group skills. In addition, out-of-class experiences seem to be more influential on female students’ development of all three learning outcomes than male students’ development of those same skills. Thus, engineering programs and faculty members could encourage to get involved in activities outside of the classroom, such as studying abroad and involvement in professional society chapters. \r\n\r\nConversations about national policies shaping student learning in higher education are likely to suffer when researchers and policy makers discount comprehensive research designs and ignore the role of gender in student learning. National policy probably should not overlook differences in the pathways to learning for male and female students. The desire to find the silver bullet that will enhance learning for all students narrows, rather than enriches, actions and policies. If academic and policy decision-making ignores gender differences in students’ experiences and learning outcomes, a true transformation of male-dominated fields will never occur and women’s experiences and levels of learning will not reach their ultimate potential. \r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"One of the fundamental issues in bilingual language research has been determining how multiple language representations develop over the course of acquisition.  In an effort to explore this, previous research adapted a traditionally monolingual statistical learning word segmentation task to provide input from two artificial languages, thereby simulating the early stages of bilingual acquisition.  The goal of that study was to determine whether learners could form multiple representations for each input language and encapsulate information in each of the input speech streams, an ability that would facilitate learning in cases where statistical interactions between the languages might interfere with proper learning.  The results demonstrated that adult learners can track two sets of statistics at once (i.e., encapsulating the information within each language), suggesting that they can form multiple representations when confronted with multiple language input.  This process was facilitated by an indexical cue of speaker voice.  In the absence of such an indexical cue, learners combined input across both languages, resulting in reduced learning when presented with statistically incompatible language pairs.  \r\n\r\nThe present study examines whether the process of forming multiple representations in bilingual segmentation tasks can be facilitated by visual cues such as videos of faces speaking the artificial languages.  Previous research has demonstrated that synchronous visual displays (such as faces) can facilitate infants' performance on a segmentation task.  Here, two artificial languages with incompatible statistics were paired with videos of two synchronous, dynamic faces.  With the faces serving as an indexical cue to language, participants learned each language significantly above chance, replicating previous results. Further experimental conditions demonstrate that this effect hinges on indexical synchronous information being available to the learner.   Neither a static visual cue of color background nor a dynamic display of faces that produce both languages (and therefore not indexical) facilitated segmentation. These results suggest that faces are particularly effective indexical cues for facilitating the encapsulation of statistical information in a bilingual word segmentation task, underscoring the potentially important role for audio-visual synchrony in the course of normal language acquisition.  \r\n\r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"Ceria (CeO2) is a rare-earth metal oxide with a wide variety of applications in hydrocarbon conversion catalysis due to its ability to exchange lattice oxygen with reactant species.  Ceria in combination with other rare earth or transition metals exhibits unique activity for hydrocarbon oxidation and high-temperature desulfurization.  The structure and functionality of the transition metal-ceria surface is a function of synthesis and pretreatment methods, as well as catalytic operating conditions.  The development of novel ceria-based catalysts is thus largely limited by difficulties in identifying the specific nature of active sites and establishing structure-function relationships therein.  \r\nThis dissertation utilizes computational chemistry methods to examine the catalytic stability and activity of transition metal-ceria surface structures at the atomistic level and motivate future efforts in catalyst design.  Density functional theory and ab initio thermodynamics ares used to calculate activation barriers and free energies of elementary reaction steps.  The activity and thermodynamic stability of supported Pd species on Pd-ceria oxidation catalysts are probed, with emphasis on quantifying the unique hydrocarbon oxidation activity of Pd-ceria mixed oxides.  The C-H bond breaking activity of a series of transition metal-ceria mixed oxides is assessed, and a correlation is found between C-H activation energetics and oxide reducibility.  The energetics of adsorption of H2S over ceria-lanthanide mixtures are also calculated, to assess the requirements of an effective ceria-based high temperature desulfurization sorbent.  \r\nThe use of DFT and  reactive force field methods to probe multi-component heterogeneous catalyst surfaces is evaluated to direct future multi-scale studies of palladium-ceria oxidation catalysts and ceria-lanthanide desulfurization sorbents.\r\n\r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"All cities have some form of informal spaces within them and these spaces grow along with the city. This growth in informal spaces is perceived as disorganized and chaotic. The traditional role of city planners is to eliminate or curtail this disorganization. In an attempt to organize the growing city structure, planners are still looking at conventional approaches, and, as a result, they end up designing static spaces. But this disorganized structure, when looked closely, is a self-organizing system. The planners need to understand the self-organization of informal spaces and need to take it into account while designing them. \r\nJohn Holland’s framework of complexity theory explains the self-organization and emergence of a system. This thesis hypothesizes that Holland’s framework is the best approach to understand and design informal spaces. The conventional approach, taken by the authorities, is evaluated using Holland’s framework with the aim to develop a better analysis strategy for the design of these spaces. For this purpose, this thesis looks at the case of Mumbai’s informal railway markets as an example of complex systems. Three cases of informal railway markets and a market built by the authority to replace the informal markets were selected for this study. The markets were studied during a field visit, and were analyzed and compared to understand their pattern and how they work as system. Issues of congestion, messy image, safety, and security were studied to understand the problems of the informal markets. The solutions proposed by authorities and counter proposals were then evaluated using Holland’s framework to arrive at a more effective solution for the markets. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"\tAccording to the U.S. EPA, agricultural runoff is the largest source of water quality degradation in the Chesapeake Bay, accounting for 44 percent of all nutrient pollution and 65 percent of sediment pollution that enters the Bay (USEPA, 2010b).  Pennsylvania produces the second most agricultural pollution of the six states within the Bay Basin.  To combat agricultural pollution, farmers and conservation agencies around the country are turning to best management practices (BMPs).  There are many types of agricultural BMPs, but their effectiveness differs from farm to farm depending on where they are applied, how they are applied, and how they are impacted by weather.\r\n\tThe goal of this research was to determine the effects of BMP implementation on environmental losses and farm profitability, as applied to typical farms in the Lancaster, Lebanon, and Dauphin County region of Pennsylvania.  Analysis and evaluation of BMPs was conducted by modeling farms and BMPs using the Integrated Farm System Model (IFSM).\r\n\tThree baseline farms were developed to simulate typical farms in this region; a crop farm, an English dairy farm, and a Plain Sect Amish dairy farm.  BMP scenarios applied to the baseline representation of those farms were evaluated based on reduction of sediment and nutrient losses and impact on farm profitability.  The effects of BMPs were different for each farm.  Environmental losses on all farms were reduced by employing strip cropping, nutrient management, reduced tillage, and cover cropping.  Planting and harvesting of a winter cover crop reduced environmental losses over baseline conditions for the English dairy and crop farms, while increasing farm profit.  Profit increased 122% over the baseline condition when the harvested cover crop practice was combined with nutrient management on the crop farm.  Cover cropping without harvest of winter crops was effective at reducing nutrient and sediment losses for the Amish farm, while additional reductions in phosphorus and sediment losses of 71% and 91%, respectively, were observed when cover cropping was combined with no-till planting.  The English dairy baseline had fairly low environmental losses but implementation of improved nutrient management achieved an 8% reduction in nitrogen leaching while increasing profit by 17%.  For all farms, strip cropping provided a substantial decrease in losses of most nutrients and sediment and had a negligible impact on farm profitability. \r\n\tUsing IFSM to model multiple farm categories, each with multiple BMPs, produced valuable information for regional officials who make BMP recommendations for farms in the focus area.  Comparing profitability and environmental effectiveness of BMPs across multiple farm types exposes relationships between BMP suitability and farm type that should prove valuable to increasing BMP adoption, educating farmers and the public, and improving water quality.\r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"    The origin of Gamma-Ray Bursts, one of the long-standing mysteries of modern Astrophysics, has been recently established observationally by the discovery of the afterglows that follow them. The correlations between the temporal and spectral features manifested by these afterglows are in accord with the predictions of the relativistic fireball model, giving it thus a very strong support. Here we model the dynamics and radiation emission of fireballs interacting with an external medium and compare some of the results with the observations.\r\n       \r\n   We present a one-dimensional code to solve ultra-relativistic hydrodynamic problems, using the Glimm method (based on an exact Riemann solver) for an accurate treatment of shocks and contact discontinuities, and a finite differencing scheme in those regions where the fluid flow is sufficiently smooth. The accuracy and convergence of this hybrid method is investigated in tests involving strong shocks and Lorentz factors of up to ~2000.\r\n      \r\n    With the aid of the hydrodynamic code we model the interaction between an expanding fireball and a stationary external medium. We compute burst spectra and time structures arising from synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scatterings by non-thermal electrons accelerated by the shocks which form during the fireball external medium interaction. We investigate the effect of varying the most important model parameters on the resulting burst spectra, and we present a set of correlations among the spectral and temporal features of the bursts. Multi-pulse structures are simulated using a variable magnetic field and anisotropic emission, and the most important spectral and temporal properties of the pulses are compared with observations. The fireball dynamics is further followed to study the spectral evolution of the remnant emission.\r\n      \r\n    We analyze the shape of the equal photon arrival time surfaces for different dynamic and radiative regimes and homogeneous or power-law external densities, and tabulate the most relevant parameters describing the source brightness distribution over these surfaces, which are useful for more accurate analytic estimates of the afterglow evolution.\r\n      \r\n    We also present an analytical approach to calculate the dynamics of the fireball–surrounding medium interaction. It is a flexible approach, that can be easily extended to include more complex situations, such as a continuous injection of energy at the reverse shock, and the sideways expansion in non-spherical ejecta, and is computationally much less expensive than hydrodynamic simulations. We investigate the effect of the relevant model parameters on the X-ray, optical and radio fluxes, and the effects of a refreshed shock energy input, anisotropy in the ejecta, and jet sideways expansion on the afterglow light-curves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"Fire is the most important disturbance process in forests of the American west.  At the finest scales, its immediate effects on vegetation include killing of live vegetation and the consumption of dead organic debris.  At the scale of one to many hectares, it drives variability in vegetation composition and structure.  Heterogeneity in fire behavior and effects are not driven solely by the vegetation itself.  Fire interacts with weather, climate and climate teleconnections, past human management of forested landscapes, and with topography. The effect of topography on heterogeneity in fire behavior and effects is not well knows, and some evidence is contradictory.  I employ a neutral modeling approach generate an examine landscape scale patterns of fire intensity and fire effects.  Broadly, I address three main research questions: 1) what is the distribution of surface and canopy fuels in LVNP, and how do they vary with topography? 2) what is the effect of topography on landscape level heterogeneity in neutral models of fireline intensity and fire type? 3) Is topography able to explain heterogeneity in the observed severity of historic and contemporary fires and is it able to explain heterogeneity in modeled fireline intensity?  I accomplish this in stages. I use plot level data from 223 plots and 669 hemispherical photographs to assess the effect of topography—elevation, slope, and aspect—on the distribution of both surface and canopy fuels. Then I develop ten remotely sensed variables from Landast imagery and five topographic variables—elevation, slope, aspect, local topographic position, and landscape position—from the National Elevation Dataset.   I use a Random Forest algorithm to model and then predictively map canopy fuels.  In the second part, I model fire burning through homogenously distributed fuels at the 80th, 90th, and 97th percentile fuel moisture conditions and for a range of wind scenarios.  This set of simulations forms the base of our neutral model expectations and is analyzed for the effect of topography.   Finally, we map historic patches of high intensity fire effects from geo-referenced aerial photographs and extract severity data from remotely sensed images of recent fires.  We compare the topographic conditions of these real high severity patches with information on high intensity fire from the neutral model approach to assess how important topography is in explaining the distribution of different severities.  Our results show that slope angle is the most important variable for determining modeled fireline intensity, but that elevation and local topographic position are the most important variables for explaining the distribution of observed locations of high severity fire.  These result support our conclusion that some patches of vegetation may be ‘fixed in space’ through the interaction of fire with topography and fuels. \r\n",

The ultimate goal of this effort was to improve the quality of life of employees with ASD by facilitating an environment which can lead to their success.  Through a series of interviews with 54 employees with ASD and 15 supervisors managing employees with ASD, results indicated that leadership has a great effect on employee attitudes and performance, the relationship between leadership preferences is quite complex culminating in several important behaviors rather than one superior leadership theory, and performance of employees with ASD is very effective.

        "abstract_tesi":"Generation-IV reactors are currently being studied to help meet future demands\r\nfor energy production. The operating conditions of Gen-IV reactors provide new material\r\nchallenges for many reactor components, including fuel cladding. Uniform corrosion is a\r\nmajor concern for fuel cladding in two of these reactors: the Lead-cooled Fast Reactor\r\n(LFR) and the Supercritical Water Reactor (SCWR). In this study, oxide layers formed\r\non alloys 9Cr ODS and HT-9 that were exposed to a corrosion medium of supercritical\r\nwater (SCW), and alloys HT-9 and a model alloy (91 wt% Fe and 9 wt% Cr) that were\r\nexposed to a corrosion medium of lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE), are studied in crosssection\r\nusing transmission electron microscopy to reveal the reasons for their different\r\ncorrosion behavior on the basis of their oxide structure.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nThe oxide layers formed on these alloys were examined using primarily\r\ntransmission electron microscopy (TEM) diffraction and imaging, along with energy\r\ndispersive x-ray spectroscopy, and electron energy loss spectroscopy, (and also using\r\noptical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy) to complement microbeam\r\nsynchrotron x-ray fluorescence and diffraction, which was performed in parallel on the\r\nsame samples. The TEM specimens were fabricated using a focused ion beam, which\r\nallowed site-specific samples of areas up to ten times larger than those provided by\r\ntraditional methods.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nThe details of the examination of the oxide layers formed on these alloys are\r\npresented in this thesis. Examination shows that these alloys form sub-layers consisting\r\nof a magnetite outer oxide layer and a spinel inner oxide layer. In between the inner oxide\r\niv\r\nlayer and the metal of the oxides formed in SCW, an additional internal oxidation layer of\r\nchromate (9Cr ODS only), spinel, and ferrite was found. The morphology of the oxide\r\ngrains is characteristic of each corrosion medium.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nFrom the examination of the oxide layer formed of 9Cr ODS, it appears that\r\nFeCr2O4 initially develops within the internal oxidation layer along the metal grain\r\nboundaries. Between two weeks and four weeks of corrosion, the thickness of the internal\r\noxidation layer shrinks relative to the inner oxide thickness due to corrosion retardation\r\ncaused by a band of chromate (Cr2O3) at the metal/internal oxidation layer interface. The\r\nHT-9 SCW sample exhibits a highly ordered structure of oxide particles in the diffusion\r\nlayer and in the inner oxide layer. Diffraction analysis shows that as the oxide advances\r\nthrough the metal, spinel develops uniformly from within the metal grains, until the Febcc\r\ncrystal lattice transforms to the FeCr2O4 crystal lattice.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nThe oxide formed on the HT-9 LBE corroded sample appears to be influenced by\r\nthe metal structure. In particular, the grain structure of the inner oxide layer is related to\r\nthe metal lath sub-boundaries of the HT-9 LBE corroded sample, in forming “packets” of\r\noxide grains within the former austenite grains. In contrast, the oxide layer formed on the\r\nmodel alloy (91 wt% Fe and 9 wt% Cr) exhibits no preferred orientation and the metal\r\ngrain structure appears to have no influence on the advancement of the oxide. Since it\r\nappears that the oxide layer formed on the model alloy is not protective, while the oxide\r\nlayer formed on the HT-9 corroded sample appears to be protective, it is apparent that the\r\nadditional minor alloying elements of HT-9 have improved the corrosion behavior of the\r\noxide layer.\r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"The cirrus-level contrails (condensation trails) produced by jet aircraft likely have contributed to recent climate changes on regional and sub-regional scales in the U.S. and Europe.  Accordingly, there is growing concern about reducing the impacts of contrails on climate, especially the surface temperature, through improved forecasting—in real time—of when and where they are most likely to occur.  This research develops a climatology of upper troposphere (UT) meteorological conditions associated with multiple occurrences of contrails, or outbreaks, for sub-regions of the U.S. in the mid-season months of 2000-2002.  The climatology consists of composites (i.e., multi-case averages) of UT variables developed using the National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP-NCAR) reanalysis data, and is the first step in designing and verifying a retro-prediction method for contrail outbreaks.  For mapping the UT climatology of contrail outbreaks, the study develops an objective (GIS-based) regionalization of the conterminous U.S. from the overlaps of outbreak areas in the 2000-2002 period.  The regionalization reveals that the high-frequency areas of contrail outbreaks vary spatially according to mid-season month, although the Midwest U.S. has the maximum frequencies on average for the year. The UT composites of meteorological variables indicate that contrail outbreaks tend to occur in advance (to the east) of baroclinic weather systems (troughs, fronts, jet streams), which have associated upward vertical motion, moistening of the air, a thicker upper troposphere (i.e., higher and colder tropopause), and horizontal wind shear.  However, statistical analyses (e.g., contingency, logit modeling) of UT conditions associated with contrail outbreaks, reveal that the utility of particular meteorological variables and their associated map characteristics (magnitude, pattern, gradient) in retro-predicting outbreaks for the 2000-2002 study period differs by sub-region and mid-season month.  Using the statistical model results of which UT variables are the best retro-predictors for each sub-region and mid-season month, the research conducts a verification study that involves retro-predicting contrail outbreaks for July and October in 2008, and January and April 2009.  The results of the verification study are mostly positive.  They reveal that a relatively simple map-based method of retro-predicting contrail outbreaks is successful in certain U.S. sub-regions and mid-season months (e.g., the Central region in April).  Further verification studies are needed to refine the method and make it suitable for forecasting contrail outbreaks.\r\n\r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"Mixed-phase stratus clouds are the prevalent cloud type in the Arctic during the winter and transition seasons. Despite their important role in various climate feedback mechanisms they are still not well understood and are difficult to represent accurately in large-scale models. In this study the role of ice nucleation mechanisms, the influence of the coastally-generated circulations and parameterized ice crystal habit on the longevity and structure of Arctic mixed-phase clouds were examined using detailed mesoscale, cloud- and eddy-resolving model simulations.\r\nThe structure and the lifetime of simulated Arctic mixed-phase clouds were found to be highly sensitive to the concentration of ice-nuclei (IN) acting in deposition/condensation-freezing nucleation mode. Contact nucleation could not produce significant ice amounts unless the contact IN concentrations were increased to unrealistically high values. Local, coastally induced circulations were found to be responsible for maintaining the continuous ice precipitation along the coastline through transport of deposition/condensation-freezing IN from above the cloud layer. It was demonstrated that incorrect partitioning of the liquid and ice phase can produce errors  in  the  surface  radiative  budget  of  up  to  90 Wm-2. \r\nSimulated IN sensitivity and liquid/ice phase partitioning were found to depend critically on the assumed ice crystal habit. It was demonstrated that a large range of liquid or ice water path can be produced by reasonable changes in ice crystal habit mass-dimensional and terminal fall-speed relations based on data reported in the literature. The changes in ice crystal habit were shown to be related to liquid layer formation, splitting of liquid layers, and cloud dissipation mechanisms in multi-layered Arctic mixed-phase clouds. These results suggest that predicting changes in crystal habit is of significant importance for correct model representation of mixed-phase clouds.\r\nThree additional ice nucleation mechanisms (“evaporation IN”, “evaporation freezing”, and immersion freezing) were examined regarding the ability of our model to more accurately simulate liquid and ice water content, ice concentrations, and observed cloud structure. All of these mechanisms were found to be capable of producing ice crystal concentrations similar to the observed values, while maintaining the liquid content of the cloud. The observed cloud structure was also correctly reproduced for extended periods of time.\r\n\r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"Oxidative modification of low density lipoprotein is thought to play an important role in the development of atherosclerosis.  Three experiments were conducted that addressed different questions about the effects of diet on oxidative stress.  Different population groups were studied using study-specific methodologies appropriate for each study to address research questions about the effects of diet on oxidative stress.  In the first study, the combined effects of dietary fat and iron status on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation were assessed using a pharmacologic dose of an iron supplement in women with low iron status (n=26).  The experimental diets were an average American diet (AAD) [36% of energy as fat; 15% saturated fatty acids (SFA)], and a Step 2 diet (26% fat; 7% SFA).  Subjects consumed each diet for three weeks before crossing over to the other diet. In addition, subjects received either a supplement containing 160 mg of ferrous sulfate (50 mg elemental iron) or a placebo twice daily [supplement group received a total of 320 mg ferrous sulfate (100 mg elemental iron) daily].  Subjects consumed the iron supplement or placebo throughout both diet periods.  After supplementation, serum ferritin increased in the supplement group compared to the placebo group (p = 0.008). Although iron status was improved by the high-dose iron supplement, LDL oxidative susceptibility was not affected.  However, measures of LDL oxidation were affected by diet.  As expected, lag time was increased after the women consumed the low fat, low SFA diet (p < 0.0001).  Rate of oxidation and total dienes were not affected by diet.  Therefore, the results indicate that although the low fat, low SFA diet significantly increased lag time, the addition of a therapeutic dose of iron did not affect all measures of oxidative stress measured despite improved iron status in subjects receiving the supplement.  Although supplemental iron did not act as an oxidant in this study, we conclude that a blood cholesterol lowering diet can be recommended for individuals treated with supplemental iron for poor iron status to decrease cardiovascular disease risk.  \r\nThe second study was designed to examine the effects of different dietary fatty acid profiles in subjects with moderately elevated total cholesterol levels (n=12 M, n=19 F) on plasma lipids and lipoproteins and oxidative stress.  Two experimental diets were studied that provided 30% calories from fat (either olive oil or NuSun„§ sunflower oil contributed one half of the total fat), 8.3% vs. 7.9% SFA, 17.2% vs.14.2% MUFA and 4.3% vs. 7.7% PUFA (olive oil and NuSun„§ sunflower oil, respectively), and 294 mg/day of cholesterol.  The olive oil and NuSun„§ sunflower oil diets were designed to provide similar amounts of SFA whereas MUFA and PUFA levels varied, in a manner that reflected the fatty acid composition of the oils used in the respective diets.   The control diet was an average American diet (34% fat, 11.2% SFA, 14.9% MUFA, 7.8% PUFA).  Subjects consumed each diet for 4 weeks with a two-week compliance break before crossing over to the other diets. The NuSun„§ sunflower oil diet significantly reduced total and LDL cholesterol compared to the AAD (p<0.0001 and p=0.0006, respectively) and the olive oil diet (p=0.005 and p=0.008, respectively).  In contrast, there was no effect of the olive oil diet compared to the AAD on plasma lipids and lipoproteins.  Although the experimental diets were lower in total fat, plasma triglycerides did not differ among the three diets.  No significant differences were observed due to diet for rate of oxidation, total dienes, lipid hydroperoxides or alpha-tocopherol.  However, lag time increased following the olive oil diet as compared to the NuSun„§ sunflower oil diet (p=0.01). The greater total and LDL cholesterol lowering of NuSun„§ sunflower oil diet could be explained by its higher PUFA content compared to the olive oil diet.  However, the increase in PUFA may also explain the reduction in lag time observed in response to the NuSun„§ sunflower oil diet suggestive of increased oxidative susceptibility.  Despite increased oxidative susceptibility with the NuSun„§ sunflower oil diet as measured by lag time, no differences in the resulting oxidation products (total dienes and lipid hydroperoxides) were observed suggesting no adverse effects of the NuSun„§ sunflower oil diet on LDL oxidation.  Thus, since PUFA are important for cholesterol-lowering, foods that replace SFA should include a balance of unsaturated fatty acids, and not be disproportionally enriched in MUFA.  \r\nThe last study is an analysis of data collected from a clinical nutrition study conducted at Pennington Biomedical Research Center.  The objective was to evaluate the effects of two cholesterol-lowering, test diets on markers of LDL oxidation in individuals with different LDL phenotypes.  Previous studies have shown that a low fat diet may be preferable for individuals expressing LDL phenotype B and contraindicated for some persons with LDL phenotype A because they may convert to LDL phenotype B, the atherogenic LDL phenotype.  In this study, 87 normocholesterolemic men consumed an AAD that provided 37% of calories from total fat and 14% SFA; a Step 1 diet that provided 28% total fat and 9% SFA and a Step 2 diet that provided 24% total fat and 6% SFA.  Subjects consumed each diet for six weeks in a randomized crossover design.  \r\nTen subjects converted from LDL phenotype A to LDL phenotype B during the study.  The analysis included subjects who remained LDL phenotype A on all three diets (Stable A; n=55), those that remained LDL phenotype B on all three diets (Stable B; n=22), and a ¡§change¡¨ group (n=10) which converted from LDL phenotype A to LDL phenotype B in response to reductions in total and saturated fat.  Greater reductions in LDL size following the Step 2 diet were observed in the ¡§change¡¨ group compared to both the Stable A group (p=0.0002) and the Stable B group (p=0.0003).  At screening, both the Stable B group and the ¡§change¡¨ group had higher triglycerides (p<0.01) and lower HDL cholesterol (p<0.05) compared to the Stable A group.\r\nReductions in apolipoprotein A1 were observed in the Stable A and Stable B subjects following both the Step 1 and Step 2 diets compared to the AAD (p<0.0001).  The Stable A subjects had a further reduction in apo A1 following the Step 2 diet compared to the Step 1 diet (p=0.0006).  In addition, the ¡§change¡¨ group did not have a reduction in apo A1 but did have an increase in HDL3b on the Step 2 diet compared to the AAD (p=0.02) indicative of a shift to a more dense HDL particle.\r\n Lag time, total dienes and paraoxonase activity were not different between test diets. While no differences between groups was observed for lag time or paraoxonase activity, rate of oxidation and total dienes were increased in the ¡§change¡¨ group across all diets compared to the Stable A group (p=0.03 and p=0.02, respectively) and the Stable B group (p=0.06 and p=0.06, respectively).  \r\nTogether, the results of the third study suggest that with reductions in dietary fat typical of those that can be achieved in a clinical setting, a diet lower in total and saturated fat is not necessarily beneficial, nor is it detrimental for persons with LDL phenotype B.  Although a dietary reduction in total and saturated fat may induce some individuals with LDL phenotype A to switch to the more atherogenic LDL phenotype B, these individuals are not at increased risk in terms of lipid response.  However, reductions in LDL size and a shift to a more dense HDL particle are observed in these individuals as well as increases in rate of oxidation and total dienes. Compared to those who remain LDL phenotype A or B with dietary intervention, there appear to be metabolic differences in individuals who change LDL phenotype in response to changing diet.  Therefore, individuals who change LDL phenotype in response to diet appear to be at increased risk in terms of their overall lipid profile, LDL and HDL size and susceptibility of LDL to oxidation.\r\n\tCollectively, the results of these three studies show that different dietary interventions did not have substantive effects on measures of LDL oxidation in any of the population groups studied.  There were subtle effects noted on some measures of oxidative susceptibility that appeared to be due to varying the type and amount of dietary fat.  Decreasing total fat may favorably affect lag time and decreased rate of oxidation in individuals who convert from phenotype A to B in response to a Step 1 diet.  Altering type of fat also may have subtle effects on measures of oxidative susceptibility.  For example, a diet enriched in olive oil favorably affects lag time compared with mid-oleic sunflower oil.  It will be important in future studies to evaluate whether subtle changes in measures of oxidative susceptibility are of any clinical importance.\r\n\r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"There are countless problems in the world, yet the public agenda is limited. The New York Times, in particular, has about eight front-page stories a day.  The policy issues captured in these stories send critical cues to politicians and citizens alike about which issues are important and, by exclusion, which are not. We know media attention can influence opinion and policy, but we know relatively little about the mechanisms by which this attention is distributed.  How do issues become front-page news? \r\nI develop a theory of media dynamics to explain patterns of front-page attention.  With too much information, limited agenda space, and complex institutional constraints, the media processes information disproportionately.  That is, the media does not attend to issues in proportion with their severity, nor does it keep pace with real-world changes over time.  Instead, the agenda tends to get stuck in equilibrium, centered on the same few issues day after day.  Meanwhile, information continues to unfold in all issue areas.  When the information build-up about a non-agenda issue becomes too large to ignore, attention lurches to that issue, overhauling the previous status quo.  The result: Front-page attention is skewed across issues; a few issues get the vast majority of coverage.  Additionally, changes in attention are disproportionately distributed; rather than shifting incrementally, the agenda displays periods of stasis punctuated by dramatic upheaval.  \r\nAgainst this foundation of media information-processing dynamics, I identify eight key variables that shape the content of front-page news: real-world events, prior attention, front-page congestion, scope of discussion, journalistic obligations and norms, entrepreneurial activity, public opinion, and political context.  I test my theory of how policy issues become front-page news using an original dataset of all New York Times front-page stories, 2000–2005, coded by issue (some 18,000 stories in all).  I document the skewed distribution of attention across issues and the disproportionate changes in the agenda over time.  And I develop a statistical model of front-page attention that confirms my expectations about the effects of specific variables on the news-selection process.  \r\nI give special examination to the scope of discussion—that is, the degree to which media coverage of a policy issue is concentrated on a small number of dimensions or spread across a wide range of dimensions.  My analysis suggests that scope and attention have a mutually reinforcing influence on one another.  An increase in media attention to an issue offers more “room” for the scope of discussion about the issue to expand.  At the same time, when the scope of a debate widens the additional perspectives make the issue more salient, thereby attracting more attention to the issue.   Under the right conditions, the reinforcing link between scope and attention can lead to an attention cascade.  \r\nThis study shows how front-page news, while impossible to forecast on a daily basis, exhibits strong and predictable patterns over time.  Usually, institutional constraints leave the media in a holding pattern, fixating on current hot issues.  But this equilibrium will always be disrupted—it’s just a matter of when, and by what issue.  And when the agenda changes, it does so explosively, fueled by shifts in specific event and non-event variables, including the scope of discussion.  The result is that front-page attention is very difficult to control.  Policy entrepreneurs hoping to manage the spin of an issue will be sorely disappointed.  But for advocates wanting to raise awareness of an issue, the best strategy is clear: Instead of saying the message louder, diversify the message itself. ",

        "abstract_tesi":"The purpose of this action research study was to explore the transitional experiences of adult business students during their return to higher education through an adapted first-year seminar course.  This study addressed a gap in the literature of adult business students in the first-year seminar research and explored the importance of tailoring a first-year seminar course to adult student needs.  The study participants were seven returning business students who enrolled in a special summer offering of the BSN101 Foundations of Business Administration course focused on designing a curriculum that is relevant to the adult student’s needs.  The study objectives were to understand the reasons for the students’ return to college and to examine the participants’ learning, adjustment to university life, and personal development through the course.\r\n\tThe findings from the study addressed four major themes.  First, the primary reason adult students were returning to an undergraduate business program was for advancement in their careers.  Second, the participants found that they were feeling fearful, mentioned their age, and were showing signs of low self-esteem and low self-efficacy about their ability to return to college.  However, through the first-year seminar course, BSN101, the students began to feel more positively about their decision to return to college and also felt a sense of belonging with the other adult business students in the class.  Third, the action research process allowed students to be actively engaged in the collaborative research project and gave them a sense of appreciation for each other’s experiences, which assisted in students’ learning, adjustment to university life, and personal development.  Fourth, the students were having difficulty balancing life roles and often through the course mentioned times of conflict and how important support from family, employers, faculty, and administrators was in their coping with the added stress of retuning to college.  Primary recommendations are that universities should pay attention to the needs of adult students, such as extending hours for administrative offices, having an adult student advocate, introducing new students to key administrative personnel, and taking into consideration their lived experience by tailoring the first-year orientation program.   This study contributes to the fields of higher education and adult education by sharing the importance of engaging students in faculty-student activities and paying attention to the participants who voiced changes to be made to universal, traditionally designed first-year seminar programs. \r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"Concerns have developed over the long-term sustainability and environmental consequences of intensifying agricultural production and its effect on soil quality. Three studies that assess management impacts on indicators of soil quality, the potential remediation of low soil quality, and the use of indicators to monitor soil quality are described in the six chapters of the thesis. The first study evaluated the effects of soil management from a long-term soil fertility and crop rotation experiment (HRE) and Pennsylvania on-farm practices on microbial community levels physiological profiles (CLPP) with gram-negative BIOLOG plates. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Cluster Analyses of microbial CLPP distinguished HRE treatments with manure and crop rotations more diverse than continuous corn from the other treatments and farms with routine organic amendments from no manure addition and/or wastewater irrigated farms. Although not without limitation, the CLPP can be used as an exploratory assessment of soil management. The second study evaluated soil remediation effects of compost addition on soil quality indicators and corn silage yields in three different landscape positions at a site irrigated with treated effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant and previously identified as having low soil quality. Soil quality indicators including soil enzyme activities, aggregate stability, and microbial biomass C increased with >90 Mg ha-1 compost treatment in all landscape positions. CLPP with <45 Mg ha-1 compost was different in the summit and backslope from the depression, and from >90 Mg ha-1 treatments in all landscape positions. Corn silage yields increased with increasing compost rates in the summit position. Soil quality remediation and site-specific management can be possible using organic amendments where soil quality is impaired. The third study evaluated a multivariate integration of soil quality indicators using principal components analysis (PCA) as a soil quality indexing process of a long-term experiment (HRE) and Pennsylvania farms with different management histories. Soil quality indicators included enzyme activities, soil microbial biomass C, total soil C, total soil N, and aggregate stability. All measured aspects of soil quality were influenced by soil management that included compost or manure additions, and forages and/or small grains in crop rotation. Through the indexing processes, unknown farms and the soil quality remediation results were assessed and successfully classified. The process of soil management classification and soil quality indexing could be a useful tool for farmers to evaluate farm management, and their farm management decisions. ",

        "abstract_tesi":"Climate change is an important challenge that has numerous implications for our health and well-being. Communicators have many significant roles to play in addressing this challenge. One role is to use persuasive communication to change or reinforce the public’s attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to support climate protection. Messages designed to evoke hope have the potential to be an effective strategy for influencing behavior and behavioral antecedents related to climate protection. A review of extant literature indicated that no theories existed to elucidate the role of hope in persuasion or to guide the development of hope appeals. Therefore, I developed persuasive hope theory (PHT) based on appraisal theory, a discrete model of emotions, and message design theories. PHT defines hope as a discrete emotion that involves appraisals of a future or unknown event as important, goal congruent, consistent with a better future, and possible. The theory also advances a framework of hope appeals as messages that induce hope by presenting an opportunity and that identifies ways to take advantage of the opportunity. I conducted qualitative and quantitative formative research to guide the development of hope appeal messages based on PHT. The messages focused on climate protection and, for comparison, seasonal influenza prevention. I used these messages to test PHT via two quasi-experimental studies. These studies examined relationships between subjective feelings of hope and appraisals, explored relationships between subjective feelings of hope and behavioral antecedents, assessed the effects of hope appeals, and identified individual characteristics that affect the above relationships and effects. The behavioral antecedents included self-efficacy, response efficacy, attitudes toward the recommended behaviors, and behavior intentions. The individual characteristics included perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, subjective knowledge, and environmental identity. The findings from the empirical studies predominantly support the relationships predicted by persuasive hope theory. Most significantly, the findings indicate that communicators can design messages that create hope and that increase appraisals of importance, goal congruence, future expectation, and possibility. These appraisals and feelings of hope both have implications for antecedents to behavior. Thus, this research offers several theoretical as well as practical implications for communication and persuasion scholarship and practice. \r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"The ability to think and act spatially has a variety of implications for human functioning and survival. Maps are an important tool for both navigating through and learning about the environment. Better understanding of how maps influence our spatial thought will help us to develop more complete theories of spatial development and provide better spatial education. The present study investigated the following aspects of children’s map-use: (a) whether or not two different mapping tasks elicit similar performance and strategies from children, (b) if using a map results in better survey knowledge compared to not using a map, and (c) how individual differences in spatial ability relate to map-use performance. \r\nTo address these issues, 9- to 10-year-old children (N = 58) were tested in one of three conditions: comprehension, production, or no-map. In the comprehension condition, children used a map marked with target locations and tried to place flags in the environment precisely at those target locations. In the production condition, children searched for flags in the environment and then placed stickers on a map to indicate the flags' locations. In the no-map condition, children searched for flags without a map in order to solve a riddle. After completing the search task in one of these three conditions, children completed measures of environmental survey knowledge and of spatial skills. \r\nComprehension and production tasks were hypothesized to be conducive to different levels of strategy use during the task. Performance was expected to be affected by these different strategies. Specifically, it was predicted that the comprehension task would elicit greater map use (looking at, aligning, and touching the map), which would, in turn, lead to better performance. It was also predicted that children in either map condition (comprehension or production) would do better on measures of survey knowledge in comparison to children in the no-map condition. Spatial skills as measured by paper-and-pencil tests were hypothesized to be positively related to performance on the mapping task.\r\nAs hypothesized, results showed that accuracy in placing the flags or stickers differed between children in the comprehension and production groups. This effect was mediated by strategy use such that those in the comprehension condition spent a greater proportion of time aligning, looking at, and touching the map and this greater use of strategies was associated with better performance on placing the flags. The hypothesis that map use would lead to better survey knowledge was not supported by the data and potential reasons for this finding are discussed. Results provided support for the hypothesis that performance on laboratory paper-and-pencil spatial tasks would predict performance on the mapping tasks.\r\nThis study shows that comprehension and production mapping tasks do not elicit equivalent strategies or performance, and thus implies that caution is needed when selecting methods for mapping research. The finding that performing a search task in an environment with a map does not necessarily lead to better survey knowledge than exploring it without a map raises several questions about how map use might be related to the acquisition of survey knowledge more generally. More broadly, this study has implications for the design of mobile mapping devices and the education of map skills.\r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"Understanding the detailed ignition, flame spreading, and combustion processes inside of a granular solid propellant bed is vital for accurate internal ballistic modeling and development of weapon systems. To characterize these items, a modular test chamber was designed, fabricated, and utilized to analyze ignition processes in axial, radial, and azimuthal directions. A percussion primer and black powder igniter jet were fired into a bed of an inert material which simulates the geometric properties of the live granular propellant to characterize its penetration. These particles were analyzed with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) to confirm that the condensed phase species contain potassium species as predicted by equilibrium analyses. Three correlations were found which describe the region affected in the granular bed by condensed phase products of the igniter jet including: axial depth of penetration, maximum radial penetration, and the volume of the coated region. They are related by: the Reynolds number based on the jet diameter, the ratio of pressure in the igniter jet to the ambient, and the ratio of bed particle diameter to orifice diameter. Through the use of high-speed photography, photodetectors, and pressure transducers igniter jet penetration into the granular bed was examined in terms of its influence on flame spreading behavior. The igniter jet is shown to fully penetrate the bed, over approximately 1 ms, before any major granular bed combustion was measured through pressure time traces, high-speed photography, or photodetector signals. Tests performed with high-speed photodetectors, sensitive to either the visible and infrared spectrum, show that the relative spread between the hot gaseous front and the flame front can be determined utilizing this windowed test chamber. The axial fronts were separated by an average of 0.15 ms at 4000 to 6000 psia.",

The present study examined associations between cardiovascular reactivity and children’s displays of fear and high-intensity pleasure in a typically developing sample (mean = 7.91, 47.6% female). RSA suppression and autonomic profiles characterized by RSA suppression were more common in the fear task than in the high-intensity pleasure task. Cardiovascular reactivity was not predictive of fear. Children who showed the autonomic profile of Reciprocal SNS activation displayed more pleasure than children with the profile of Reciprocal PNS activation. This is one of the first studies to document associations between cardiovascular reactivity and children’s display of a positive emotion. Further, this study also demonstrated the utility of using autonomic profiles to understand links between behavioral and physiological markers of emotion reactivity. \r\n\r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"Gender inequality in sub-Saharan Africa has far-reaching implications; fertility, mortality, sexual behavior, infant health, and domestic violence are all negatively impacted by inequalities between men and women. Gender gaps in education depress economic growth in the region, and scholars and practitioners alike assert that the amelioration of gender inequality in Africa is critical for further development on the continent. Because the preponderance of research on gender in sub-Saharan Africa examines women’s perspectives, we do not know the full extent to which African men endorse gender equity, or the best approaches to gaining men’s support for greater equality. In the discourse, men are often treated as homogenously problematic and resistant, rather than as a potential source of support for gender equality and gender-focused policies. \r\n\r\nThrough a mixed methods approach, this study utilizes 33 in-depth interviews with gender-equitable Ghanaian men and the 2003 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey (2003 GDHS), to identify the processes through which some Ghanaian men develop gender-equitable attitudes within this male-dominant context. Using social cognitive theory as a framework to investigate the life course experiences that shape men’s gender-equitable attitudes, an exploratory analysis of the 2003 GDHS reveals that men’s gender attitudes differ by men’s individual, family and environmental characteristics. In-depth interviews with gender-equitable Ghanaian men reveal that natal families, schooling environments, and peer relationships influence the emergence of gender-equitable attitudes. Additionally, men can develop more gender-equitable attitudes in adulthood through experiences that replicate familial, peer, and schooling socialization. As specified by social cognitive theory, men’s personality characteristics are also important, as these influence how individuals understand and interact with their environments. Life course experiences work cumulatively to cultivate the emergence of gender-equitable attitudes among Ghanaian men. \r\n\r\nThis study also explores the nature of gender-equitable attitudes among Ghanaian men. Specifically, it identifies how Ghanaian men embody their gender-equitable attitudes, and the social costs and benefits of living out these attitudes. Respondents share a set of core beliefs that guide their gender-equitable perspectives, and a commitment to exhibit these values in their daily lives. Gender-equitable Ghanaian men experience a number of social costs as a result of their gender-equitable perspectives, but respondents agree that the personal benefits of their gender attitudes outweigh these costs. \r\n\r\nThis study provides guidance as to where crucial intervention points exist for shaping greater gender-equitable attitudes among men, and offers a constructive commentary on current gender-related policy and programmatic interventions in the region. Also, these findings expand empirical and theoretical understanding of men and masculinities in sub-Saharan Africa, and contribute to the deconstruction of the pervasive assumption that all African men are barriers to gender equity.\r\n\r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"Two research studies were conducted in normo- and hypertriglyceridemic individuals to determine the quantitative and qualitative effects of dietary fatty acids in the fasting and fed states, respectively.  A randomized controlled feeding study was conducted to evaluate the effects of the chronic consumption of a low-fat versus a moderate-fat diet.  The results of the studies conducted demonstrate that chronic intake of dietary patterns at either end of the recommended range of total dietary fat intake (20-35% total kcal) improves levels of serum lipids and lipoproteins.  Despite a reduction in fasting triglycerides following the low-fat diet, hypertriglyceridemic individuals had higher levels of atherogenic apolipoproteins following the low-fat diet, compared to the moderate-fat diet.  Based on this study, the recommendation to consume a more moderate fat diet must also include a focus on the quality of the fat being consumed.  The results of the second study, a randomized crossover design postprandial study indicate that the consumption of different kinds of fatty acids have very different affects on postprandial risk factors for CVD.  In particular, the simple heating of a PUFA increased levels of individual trans fatty acid isomers and lipid hydroperoxides, resulting in diverse physiological responses, compared to the same un-heated PUFA.  In summary, whereas the implementation of a very healthy low-fat diet may have adverse affects on the apolipoprotein profile of individuals with elevated baseline triglyceride levels, the inclusion of unsaturated fatty acids in a moderate-fat diet, has a significant hypotriglyceridemic effect in individuals, regardless of baseline triglyceride status.  In making the recommendation to consume a moderate-fat diet it is important to recognize the effects of individual fatty acids on postprandial risk factors for cardiovascular disease.  In particular, the heating of highly unsaturated fatty acids leads to the production of trans fatty acids and lipid oxidation end products.  The diverse physiological responses observed thus indicate that a diet rich in mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids is optimal, when compared to a diet rich in saturated and/or trans fatty acids.

        "abstract_tesi":"A computational study is performed to develop a capability of analyzing the effect damage has on the aerodynamic performance of airfoils.  A Cartesian immersed boundary method is implemented in 2D simulations of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations.  These equations are discretized using a Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) scheme for spatial derivatives and a 4th order Runge-Kutta scheme for temporal derivatives.  Results from time-accurate, parallel computations are presented for a NACA 0009 airfoil in both undamaged and damaged states.  Time histories of lift, drag, and moment coefficients are shown, along with Mach contours and turbulent kinetic energy contours at three times throughout the simulations.  Based on these initial results, it was determined that the boundary conditions used in the simulations were causing reflections of propagating disturbances which contaminate the solution.  Further studies must be completed with the current methodology using alternate boundary conditions to validate its results prior to continuing its development for this application in aircraft survivability.\r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"Quinolinate synthase catalyzes the formation of quinolinic acid, a key intermediate in the biosynthesis of the cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.   In prokaryotes, quinolinic acid is synthesized via the concerted action of two enzymes, L-aspartate oxidase, and quinolinate synthase (NadA).  L-aspartate oxidase, a flavin-dependent enzyme that converts L-aspartic acid to iminoaspartate, has been well-characterized.  In contrast, few studies have been conducted on NadA, which catalyzes a condensation reaction between iminoaspartate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate to form quinolinic acid.  Recent work has found that Escherichia coli NadA contains a [4Fe-4S]2+, and that this cluster may serve a direct role in catalysis.  Further support for the role of the iron-sulfur cluster in catalysis is established here through investigations of NadA from E. coli, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Pyrococcus horikoshii.\r\n\tWhile initial work with E. coli NadA has established the presence of an iron-sulfur cluster, this work indicates its necessity for catalysis.  Isolation of a cluster-less apoprotein is described, and subsequent spectroscopic and activity analysis of the apoprotein indicates that is in fact unable to catalyze the formation of quinolinic acid.  Additionally, the cluster can be chemically reconstituted in this form of the protein, yielding a catalytically active form of NadA, with characteristics nearly identical to the holoprotein previously described.\r\nAn understanding of NadA from M. tuberculosis could be of use in designing new antimicrobial drugs to combat this deadly human pathogen.  Although the M. tuberculosis NadA sequence does not contain the CX2CX2C motif that is commonly found in 4Fe-4S enzymes it does possess an iron-sulfur cluster similar to that in E. coli.\r\n\tA recent report of the crystal structure of NadA from the archeon P. horikoshii describes catalytic activity of the protein in the absence of an iron-sulfur cluster.  To reproduce this observation independently, the P. horikoshii nadA gene was cloned and the protein purified under anaerobic conditions.   The isolated protein did in fact contain a [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster in its catalytically active form, while apoprotein, or protein isolated under aerobic conditions showed no activity.  The lack of cluster in the previously reported structure is believed to result from oxygen exposure.  To gain further understanding of this enzyme and the role of its cluster in catalysis, studies were initiated to obtain a crystal structure of the protein with an intact cluster.\r\n",

Both siblings reported on four dimensions of sibling relationship quality, and younger siblings reported on their developmental assets (positive identity, positive values, support, boundaries and expectations, social competence, and commitment to learning).  Analyses revealed that, after controlling for parent-adolescent relationship quality, sibling warmth was associated with higher levels of developmental assets and sibling conflict, control, and relational aggression were associated with fewer developmental assets.  The gender composition of the sibling dyad moderated these linkages, however, such that sibling relationship quality and positive development were more often correlated in opposite sex sibling, than in same sex sibling dyads.  \r\n\r\n",

Ultramicroelectrode (UME) fabrication, including photodeposition and electrodeposition of Rh and Au, and the reliability of the resulting electrodes were explored.  It was determined that rhodium does not bind strongly enough to glassy carbon by these photodeposition techniques to allow for its use on rotating disk electrodes.  Epoxy deteriorates under conditions of rhodium photodeposition.  Niobium is unfit for exposed electrode surfaces because of its many different oxide states.  Gold UME surfaces recede with use into their glass insulation surroundings.  And 25 &#956;m thick gold and rhodium wires disintegrate in flames too quickly to allow for their use in traditional UME construction.  \r\nIn the second project, flash-photolysis and time-resolved photolysis studies were intended to illuminate the kinetics of charge transfer for the reduction half of a water splitting system involving hexaniobate nanoscrolls, nanoparticulate Pt reduction catalysts, and Ru(bpy)2(4,4’-(PO3H2)2bpy)2+ dye.  Solid state synthesis and exfoliation techniques were used to produce the nanoscrolls, and XRD and TEM were used to confirm the identity of the product and success of Pt photodeposition.  \r\n",

A key\r\nmethodological issue is whether old survey data, collected at a time when today’s questions had\r\nnot yet been formed, can still prove useful.\r\nThis dissertation investigates the viability of old survey data, some of the environmental\r\ninfluences – landform, elevation, temperature, precipitation – and settlement population density,\r\non site location choice in the Mesa Verde Southwest. I also investigated the effects of large sites\r\non small site location and looked at all these factors with respect to reinhabited sites versus\r\npristine sites.\r\nMy results suggest a method to determine which old surveys can be used, and which\r\ncannot. The site populations in the mesa surveys are similar but differ from the site populations of\r\nthe non-mesa surveys, indicating a possible difference in settlement pattern between mesas and\r\nother areas. Site population in general increased through time. Wetherill Mesa is the only location\r\nwhere Late Pueblo III site population dipped dramatically, probably due to movement into\r\naggregated cliff locations. Mesa-top sites remained the majority through time, but population\r\npressure caused people to move sites to the talus slopes. No large site influence pushes sites up or\r\ndown in elevation, but population pressure does expand the range of elevations inhabited.\r\nDistances to large sites from small sites do not change the appearance of large sites. Small sites\r\nmove away from or toward large sites without pattern.\r\nThe environment appears to influence small site locations far more than proximity to large\r\nsites. While large sites might have influenced the myriad small-site inhabitants by altering their\r\nsocial and political life, they did not seem to alter the locations people chose for their homes.\r\nPopulation pressure seems to be the largest influence on the settlement patterns in the Mesa\r\nVerde area.\r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"Canonized by Max Weber’s “Science as a Vocation”, the distinction between fact and value and the principle of Wertfreiheit (value freedom) have become foundational to sociological practice. In scientific discourse, facts refer to observed information that is both verifiable and reliable. A fact denotes “the real.” Values, variously defined, are conceptualized as part of an unobservable subjective realm. The epistemological assumptions supporting this position are rarely problematized. Considering the philosophical influences upon Weber’s sociology, I view the fact/value dichotomy as an artifact of the Kantian separation of subject and object. Pragmatist philosophy offers an alternative to the Western tradition of dualism.  A comparison of pragmatism with Weber’s verstehende Soziologie reveals a surprising number of affinities and provides a framework for exploring the entanglement of fact and value. Using freedom as a paradigm case, I demonstrate the significance of recognizing the entanglement of fact and value for empirical research.  ",

        "abstract_tesi":"\tThis thesis focuses on the synthesis and characterization of mixed-substituent poly(organophosphazenes).  The work in chapters 2 through 4 examines mixed-substituent polyphosphazenes with fluoroalkoxy side groups.  Chapters 2 and 3 involve a synthetic route to mixed-substituent polyphosphazenes via side group replacement of fluoroalkoxy substituents.  The thermal and mechanical properties of mixed-substituent poly(fluoroalkoxyphosphazenes) are examined through varying the ratios of two fluoroalkoxy substituents.  These structure-property relationships and the potential use of these materials as fluoroelastomers are the subjects of chapter 4.  The specifics of chapters 2-4 are summarized below.  The work in chapter 5 concerns the synthesis and evaluation of mixed-substituent polyphosphazenes as single-ion conductors.  The synthesis of a sulfonimide functionalized side group for proton conducting fuel cell applications is the subject of the appendix and is also utilized in the work in chapter 5.  The specific details of the ionic conducting polymer studies are also summarized below. \r\n\r\n\r\n\tIn chapter 2, several poly(alkoxyphosphazenes) and poly(fluoroalkoxyphosphazenes) were synthesized and allowed to react with various organic nucleophiles.  Reactions were carried out at room temperature (25 oC) and at 67 oC in tetrahydrofuran (THF) and were monitored by 31P NMR spectroscopy.  The possible use of single-substituent polymers as hydrolytically stable macromolecular intermediates for mixed-substituent polyphosphazene synthesis is discussed and factors that influence side group replacement in poly(organophosphazenes) are examined.  In addition, evidence for a random, irreversible SN2-like mechanism of side group replacement is presented.  The work in chapter 3 is complementary to chapter 2 and examines the equilibrium exchange reactions of fluoroalkoxy substituents and fluoroalkoxy nucleophiles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tIn chapter 4, a series of poly(fluoroalkoxyphosphazenes) containing a mixture of 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5-octafluoropentoxy and 2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy substituents was synthesized.  The series included polymers with 25-94% incorporation of the trifluoroethoxy substituent, as well as single-substituent polymers with 100% octafluoropentoxy or trifluoroethoxy side groups. The polymers were analyzed by multi-nuclear NMR spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography (GPC), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and were subjected to limiting oxygen index and microtensile testing.  The variation in thermal and mechanical properties as a function of the side group ratios is discussed and polymers that may be suitable for fabrication into low temperature elastomer materials are identified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe use and evaluation of mixed-substituent polyphosphazenes as single ion conductors is described in chapter 5.  Polyphosphazenes with both 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy and lithiated sulfonimide functionalized side groups were synthesized and characterized using multi-nuclear NMR, GPC, flame atomic absorption (FAA) spectroscopy, elemental analysis (EA), and DSC.  The sulfonimide functional group was lithiated via dialysis with aqueous lithium chloride solutions.  Lithiation was confirmed by FAA spectroscopy and EA.  The polymers were examined for their behavior as single ion conductors using impedence analysis.  The dependence of the conductivity on the macromolecular motion of the polymers and on the amount of sulfonimide functionalized side group is discussed.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\tChapter 6 briefly describes potential future research directions based on the work presented in chapters 2 through 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe appendix describes the synthesis of the sulfonimide functionalized side group.  This work also examines this side group for use in polyphosphazene proton conducting fuel cell membranes. \r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"Currently, modeling the combustion of aviation turbine fuels is not feasible due to the complexity and variation of real fuels.  Surrogates, created out of a few pure hydrocarbon compounds, are a key step toward modeling new engines and new fuels.  For the surrogate to simulate the real fuel, the composition must be designed to reproduce certain pre-designated parameters.  In the present research, instead of attempting to match distillation curves or estimates of the composition of the real fuel, three combustion related parameters including hydrogen to carbon (H/C) ratio, cetane number, and sooting tendency are to be reproduced.  The objective of this thesis is to characterize the sooting tendency.  The tendency of a fuel to produce soot in the combustor is relevant because it affects flame radiation as well as emissions.  Parameters which characterize sooting tendency include hydrogen content, H/C ratio, smoke point, Threshold Soot Index (TSI), Yield Sooting Index (YSI), and others.  In this work, TSI, which is derived from the smoke point measurement, is used.  \r\nPrevious data on TSI had been scaled inconsistently, and widely differing values for some compounds had been reported.  In addition, the TSI for a key iso-alkane, iso-cetane, had not been measured.  Therefore this work sought to provide a complete and consistent set of TSI values for surrogate components.  Smoke point heights of sixteen compounds were measured according to ASTM D1322, and TSI values were derived from these measurements.  The soot threshold and soot yield (YSI) data from prior studies were rescaled with a correlation to the TSI values from the current study.  The magnitude of the correlation coefficient was used to determine whether the data set was used in the final average TSI values.  Results showed that the differences in TSI values were significantly reduced by scaling all the data sets in this manner.\r\nOnce individual TSI values are known, the resulting TSI when components are mixed together can be predicted.  Previous researchers tested a mixture rule, which was shown to hold for the mixtures investigated.  In this work, it was found that six additional binary mixtures and four multi-component mixtures follow the same mixture rule.  A method of calculating the TSI of a single component from the mixture TSI was used to obtain a TSI value for iso-cetane, which could not otherwise be measured, and to verify the TSI value for 1-methylnaphthalene.\r\nDue to the complex molecular structures of aromatics, it is one of the hydrocarbon classes for which developing chemical kinetic models is difficult.  Among the hydrocarbon families, aromatics also have the highest sooting tendencies, and their presence has the most effect on TSI.  Due to inadequate development of some chemical kinetic models, certain aromatic compounds may need to be replaced with others for which models exist.  The TSI values of three mixtures were tested to show that TSI can be replicated using different combinations of compounds for the aromatic fraction of the mixture.  \r\nThe methodology of designing surrogates based on TSI was applied to JP-8, the USAF jet fuel.  The smoke point height of JP-8 was measured, and the TSI was obtained using an estimated molecular weight.  A surrogate, created to match the JP-8 TSI, produced the same value within the estimated uncertainty.   The formation of a set of TSI values for individual compounds and the verification of a mixture rule showed that TSI can be used as a sooting tendency parameter for designing surrogate composition.\r\n\r\n",

        "abstract_tesi":"The two-method measurement design was applied to answer substantive questions pertaining to hypertension and several lifestyle-based risk factors; specifically, analyses involved estimating the cross-sectional association of three blood pressure parameters (systolic blood pressure (SBP); diastolic blood pressure (DBP); and pulse pressure (PP)) and four known hypertension risk factors (physical conditioning; dietary intake; body fat; and tobacco use). The two-method measurement design, a recent statistical advancement in the area of planned missingness approaches, measures constructs using several indicators of variable cost and validity. Cheaper, less valid measures of a construct and more expensive, valid measures of the same construct collectively serve as manifest indicators. All participants provide data for the cheap measures; a small proportion of participants also provide data for the expensive measures. When at least a subsample of participants provide complete data, bias correction models allow for the modeling of measurement bias (i.e., reduced construct validity) associated with the cheap measures; resulting parameter estimates are efficient and unbiased. \r\n\r\nA simulation paradigm was used to apply the two-method measurement design to empirical NHANES data. The performance of the two-method measurement design was compared to that of financially-equivalent complete case designs. For two of the four predictors – body fat and tobacco use – application of the two-method measurement design produced statistical power advantages beyond those yielded by the financially-equivalent complete cases models. Under a hypothetical budget constraint of $20,000, complete case body fat data could be collected from N=333 participants; however, the two-method measurement design behaved as if the complete case sample sizes were N=1469, N=1625, and N=1565 for testing the effects between body fat and SBP, DBP, and PP, respectively. Under the same budget of $20,000, complete case tobacco use data could be collected from N=363 participants; the two-method measurement design behaved as if the sample sizes were N=1513, N=655, and N=872 for testing the effects between tobacco use and SBP, DBP, and PP, respectively. Application of the two-method measurement design was comparatively less effective for the physical conditioning and dietary intake variables. A potential explanatory factor involves the general lack of association between cheap and expensive measure indicators for these two variables.\r\n\r\nIn general, the strength of association between the independent and dependent variables was inversely correlated with the increase in statistical power produced by the two-method measurement design (results consistent with previous research). Results have implications for future application guidelines. To maximize the utility of the two-method measurement design, cheap and expensive measures for a given construct should be highly correlated. It is recommended that researchers collect small amounts of data from candidate cheap measures to determine, a priori, the set of cheap measures that best correlates with expensive measure data. It is also helpful if researchers are able to anticipate, to some degree, effect sizes between independent and dependent variables of interest; this offers researchers the opportunity to more accurately tailor data collection to achieve maximal cost-effectiveness. \r\n\r\nRecent interest in the efficiency of health prevention programs, as well as limited external funding sources, has placed an increased emphasis on cost-effective research within many behavioral health disciplines. Whenever researchers have the opportunity to collect data for a particular construct using several measures of variable cost and construct validity, the two-method measurement design offers the potential for cost-effective data collection and unbiased and efficient parameter estimation.\r\n",
