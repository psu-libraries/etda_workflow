    <h3>Released August 2019: Committee Member Approval via Digital Signatures</h3>
    <h4>How Do I Provide Approval of Students' Theses and Dissertations?</h4>
    <p>Committee members are required to review and provide their approval for submitted works that they are a part of.  The revised process will no longer involve a paper signature form and is managed electronically.   The process will start after students have passed all internal checks from the partnering program.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Each committee member will receive an email with a link to the ETDA (Electronic Thesis and Dissertation Application).</li>
      <li>Upon login you will be presented with a list of the submission(s) that require attention.</li>
      <li>Click the title of the submission to process that particular submission.</li>
