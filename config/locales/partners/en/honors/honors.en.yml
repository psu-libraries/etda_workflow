        text: <p>Electronic submission of the final Honors Thesis became a requirement beginning spring semester 2010. Honors theses submitted prior to spring semester 2010 will not be found on this database. Both the mandatory draft submission and the final thesis must be submitted electronically through this site.</p><p>All final theses are open to the public. If there is a reason (usually for patent or proprietary purposes) your thesis should not be released to the public, you must contact the Schreyer Honors College and request restricted access. Restricted access may be granted for a period up to two years. The thesis will be automatically released for public access at end of the approved restricted period.</p>

                    When you submitted your electronic %{degree_type} (eHT) to the %{partner_name} in %{submission_year},
                    you elected to restrict access to it for two years. The time has come to change it to open access.
                    Please acknowledge that you are aware that your eHT will be available as an open document on our
                    eHT Web site (https://honors.libraries.psu.edu/catalog)
                    If you or your advisor are in the process of seeking a patent associated with your %{degree_type} and
                    have filed an Invention Disclosure with the Office of Technology Management, we can grant another two-year extension
                    of the restriction. Please let us know immediately if this is the case.
                    If you are seeking publication and wish to extend the restriction for that reason, we will allow a change
                    to the 'Penn State Only' option. This will allow the document to be accessed only by those with a valid
                    Penn State Access Account, and will provide an additional two-year period until open access. Please
                    let us know if you need to use this option.
                    In any case, it is important that you respond to this message. Thank you.
