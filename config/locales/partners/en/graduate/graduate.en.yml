        title: Graduate School Theses and Dissertations
        text: <p>The primary purpose of a thesis or dissertation is to train the student in the process of scholarly research and writing under the direction of members of the Graduate Faculty. After the student has graduated and the work is published, it serves as a contribution to human knowledge, is useful to other scholars and perhaps even to a more general audience. Electronic thesis and dissertations (eTDs) expand the creative possibilities open to students and empower students to convey a richer message by permitting video, sound, and color images to be integrated into their work. Submitting and archiving eTDs helps students to understand electronic publishing issues and provides greater acess to students' research. Through the Web, people from any place on the globe can link directly to eTD collections at Penn State and other universities.</p><p>The Graduate School, the University Libraries, and the Graduate Faculty of Penn State have established format standards that theses and dissertations must meet before receiving final approval as fulfillment of graduate requirements.  The Office of Theses and Dissertations staff is responsible for verifying that all eTDs have met these requirements <a href="%{thesis_guide_link}">(refer to the Thesis and Dissertation Guide)</a>.  The text of the eTD should be proofread and free of grammatical errors and typos.  It is extremely important that the author carefully review and proofread the thesis or dissertation before submitting the final document.  After the official approval of the final eTD by the Office of Theses and Dissertations, changes will not be permitted.</p>
